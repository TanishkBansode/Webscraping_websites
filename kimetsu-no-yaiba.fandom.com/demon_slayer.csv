1,Cruelty,"It is the Taisho Period (i.e. 1912-1926). Tanjiro Kamado is living a modest but blissful life in the mountains with his family. One day, when he returns from selling charcoal in town, he finds the remains of his slaughtered family in pools of blood after a demon attack. Tanjiro rushes down the snowy mountain with the sole survivor, his sister Nezuko, on his back. But on the way, Nezuko suddenly snarls, turning on Tanjiro.[1]","Walking through an intense blizzard with his wounded sister, a young boy begs her to stay alive, promising to save her no matter what. Tanjiro preparing to depart. After loading a basket of charcoal on his back, Tanjiro Kamado hears his mother call to him. Wiping the soot off his face, she tells him of her worry for his safety, due to the heavy snow as he’s selling. To this, he explains his desire that everyone in his family eat well for New Year, willing to sell as much charcoal as possible. His younger brother and sister see him about to depart and wish to tag along with him; their mother doesn’t allow them, since he will be walking much faster than them. Dismayed, they both tell Tanjiro of their willingness to help him. He reassures both of them, Hanako and Shigeru, that he will give them his attention after returning. He sees his other younger brother, Takeo, and instructs him to chop firewood for them. Takeo is somewhat annoyed at being unable to join him, causing Tanjiro to gently pat his head in reassurance, to his chagrin and the laughter of his family. As he leaves, he encounters his younger sister Nezuko, carrying their youngest sibling Rokuta on her back. She tells him that since their father’s death, they had all looked up to him as a role model. Wishing him good luck as he leaves, Tanjiro mutters to himself about his family's living. They had always made the most of their uneasy life because life can change suddenly like the weather. Reaching a nearby town to begin selling his charcoal, Tanjiro hears several of the townsfolk commending and thanking him for his past deeds. Suddenly, he hears a hurt young man call to him, accused by a store clerk of breaking a plate. Using his sharp sense of smell, he deduces that a cat had broken it, to the man’s relief. Another man beckons him over for help with heavy luggage. With his basket empty and night having arrived, Tanjiro heads home but is stopped by an elderly neighbour living nearby, warning him not to enter the mountain. Though Tanjiro insists he is safe with his sense of smell, the man sternly tells him to take residence at his home for the night instead, as demons roam about during the night. Treated to dinner, Tanjiro asks the man, Saburo, about what demons are like. He tells them that demons devour humans and are only active in the dark, hence the peril of traversing the mountain at this time. Provided with a futon to sleep in, Tanjiro asks if demons would enter houses, to which Saburo says so. He then states that is the reason Demon Slayers are present to protect them. Saburo, who had lost his family to demons, is pitied by Tanjiro, who wishes to bring his siblings to meet him next time to give comfort. Tanjiro finds his family dead. At dawn, he sets out for home and leaves Saburo’s residence. But as he approaches his home, he suddenly detects the scent of blood and hurriedly runs to his house. In the front yard, he catches sight of a bloodied and lifeless Nezuko, with Rokuta in her arms. In shock, he runs over to her body and asks what had happened, before turning his head and looking inside his house. To his horror, his finds his mother and the rest of his family dead, with blood strewn throughout the house. Tanjiro carrying a wounded Nezuko. Tanjiro carries Nezuko across the snowing mountain for help in the town, having felt that her body is the only one still warm. As he tries to make sense of what could have possible occurred, the cold air causes his breathing to weaken, and he struggles to carry her through the blizzard. Without warning, Nezuko begins twitching and rears herself up as she groans in an animalistic manner. She grabs Tanjiro and hurls themselves off the mountain path down a cliff. Protected from the fall by the thick snow, Tanjiro looks up and sees his sister standing upright. When he asks if she is able to walk on her own, Nezuko instead attempts to attack him, forcing him to put his hatchet’s handle in her mouth to prevent getting bit. Tanjiro, recalling Saburo’s words, realizes Nezuko is now a demon, but doesn’t believe she was the one responsible for killing everyone else, remembering that another scent was present in the house. Nezuko grows in size and Tanjiro struggles to hold her at bay. Lamenting that his family had died brutally as he slept, Tanjiro begs her to hold back and not be a demon. Hearing his words, Nezuko begins to cry and ceases her attack on her brother. A swordsman attacks Tanjiro and Nezuko. A young man wielding a sword speeds towards the siblings and leaps into the air. Tanjiro notices him and forces Nezuko out of the way of the strike, to the swordsman’s confusion. His blade comes down and only slightly misses Tanjiro’s head; the force of the swing creates a windstorm that knocks Tanjiro and Nezuko away, the latter reducing to normal size once more. Looking up to see their assailant, Tanjiro notices the words “Destroy Demons” etched in the blade. The swordsman asks why he is protecting the demon, to which Tanjiro answers the demon is his younger sister Nezuko. Unconvinced by her growling, he lunges forward and grabs her, too fast for Tanjiro to see and react. With the demon in his grasp, the swordsman informs Tanjiro his job is to kill demons and he will now decapitate Nezuko. Upon hearing his words, Tanjiro tells the Demon Slayer that another scent was present at their house during his family’s murder and it was perhaps the true culprit. Asking how she even transformed in the first place, the Demon Slayer instead informs him that since her wounds were exposed to the demon's blood, she has transformed into one. The swordsman urges Tanjiro to remain strong. Tanjiro insists that she doesn’t eat humans, but the Demon Slayer refuses to believe him, since she tried to devour him not long ago. He promises to return Nezuko back into a human, but is told that becoming one is irreversible. As he insists he will find a way, the man raises his sword towards her neck. Remembering his lost mother and siblings, Tanjiro begs him not to kill her and take away the last fragment of his family. Angered, the Demon Slayer reprimands him for begging in the face of others and that he is only creating an opening for others to kill him. He tells Tanjiro that if groveling were the least bit effective, then his family would not be dead and harshly admonishes him for claiming that he could help his sister and hunt down a demon despite being weak, since the fate of the weak is to only be crushed. He tells Tanjiro that perhaps the demons know how to cure his sister and change her back into a human but insists that Tanjiro should not get his hopes up since they will not be willing to help similar to how the Slayer finds his idea preposterous. He tells the boy that his failures led to her capture in the first place and that he could have killed him and her in one strike if he wanted to. Seeing the tears fall of Tanjiro’s face, the Demon Slayer thinks to himself for him to not cry and despair now, despite all the pain he had recently felt. He believes that he could have saved them had he come earlier but the past is now written. As he looks at him, he tells Tanjiro to feel the rage of being unforgiving, as it will drive him to take action; without a strong resolve, he can never heal his sister or avenge his family. Tanjiro nearly hits the swordsman. The young man stabs Nezuko in the shoulder and Tanjiro retaliates by hurling a stone at him, which is quickly deflected. Thinking quickly, Tanjiro sees his fallen hatchet and runs towards the Demon Slayer in a frontal attack driven by emotion. Seeing his weak effort, the Demon Slayer slams his sword handle into Tanjiro’s back, knocking him unconscious. Suddenly, he notices that Tanjiro isn’t armed. He hears the sound of a spinning object, looking up in time and ducking his head to the side as the hatchet flies towards him, barely missing its mark. Impressed at Tanjiro’s attempt to strike him down regardless of his inferior strength and technique, Nezuko breaks free of the swordsman’s hold in his short lapse of focus. Kicked backed, he sees the demon about to pounce on the unconscious Tanjiro. Nezuko attacks the swordsman. Instead of killing him, Nezuko stands in front of her brother, ready to protect him. The slayer recalls Tanjiro’s words that Nezuko would never harm humans and quickly believes them, despite recalling that someone else said the same thing about their family member only to be devoured in the end long ago and knowing that demons will often kill their own family members after transforming. As Nezuko attacks Giyu to protect Tanjiro, he realizes that she is wounded and spending energy to both heal her wounds and fight him, while fighting against eating her brother for food. Realizing this demon is different, the swordsman opts to spare her, sheathing his blade and knocking her unconscious instead. As Tanjiro lays in the snow, he is visited by visions of his deceased family; his mother apologizes for leaving him and asks he take care of Nezuko. He awakens to find her beside him, with a bamboo muzzle. Having waited for him to regain consciousness, the Demon Slayer instructs him to find an old man named Sakonji Urokodaki, who lives at the foot of Mount Sagiri, telling him that he, Giyu Tomioka, had sent him. Giyu warns him not to let Nezuko get exposed to sunlight before disappearing. After burying his family in the front yard of their house, Tanjiro takes Nezuko’s hand and together, they leave their home and make their way to the mountain.

2,Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki,"At Giyu Tomioka's urging, Tanjiro heads for Mt. Sagiri with his sister Nezuko, who's been turned into a demon. During the night, Tanjiro catches the scent of blood from inside a temple. He enters, thinking that someone might be hurt, only to come upon a man-eating demon. When the demon attacks, Tanjiro manages to fight back with his axe, but the demon's strength is overwhelming. Just as the demon is about to finish him off, Tanjiro is saved by none other than...[1]","On the way to Mount Sagiri, Tanjiro asks a nearby farmer if he can take his basket, along with straw and bamboo to fix it. The farmer allows him and Tanjiro offers to pay. The farmer denies payment since it has holes but Tanjiro wants to give him money. The man offers the straw and bamboo for free as well but Tanjiro stubbornly offers to give him money. Annoyed, he tells Tanjiro he can take it for free once again, only for him to slaps several coins into his hand, before running away and thanking him as the farmer yelps in pain. Tanjiro finds a demon inside a temple. Tanjiro finds Nezuko in a nearby dirt tunnel; she has also dug herself into the ground, showing her great reluctance of seeing sunlight. After repairing the basket, Tanjiro asks if she can fit inside, talking slowly as he is unsure she can fully understand him. After shrinking herself to fit inside, Tanjiro straps the basket on his back. Now able to carry her while protecting her from the sun, Tanjiro makes his way to the mountain, asking for directions from a nearby woman; she also warns Tanjiro that people have gone missing as of late and urges him to be careful. Once night arrives, Tanjiro and Nezuko find a temple in the woods. As he approaches, he smells blood and runs inside. Upon opening the doors, he freezes upon catching sight of a demon living inside, eating several corpses. The smell of blood causes Nezuko to salivate. Nezuko attacks the Temple Demon. The demon lunges at Tanjiro, who slashes his neck with his hatchet. Somewhat impressed by the cut, the demon showcases his powerful regeneration, healing the deep cut in seconds. With incredible speed, the demon disappears momentarily and suddenly grabs Tanjiro, who is too slow to react. Despite the smell of blood, Nezuko fights the urges and runs to save her brother, kicking the demon's head off. Initially believing she had kill him, the demon's body attempts to grab him, forcing Nezuko to kick the body to keep it at bay. The nearby demon's head begins talking to him, annoyed that he was right about one of them being a demon. The head grows arms and attacks Tanjiro, while his body batters Nezuko about and throws her deep into the nearby forest. With the demon's head attached to his hatchet, Tanjiro attacks by head butting him, stunning the demon with his hard skull. With the head attached, he hurls the hatchet at a tree, pinning the head in place; with one threat neutralized, Tanjiro makes his way to Nezuko. At a cliff's edge, Tanjiro finds the body kicking Nezuko towards the drop. He tackles the body and hurls themselves over the edge. Nezuko grabs her brother before he could fall, while the body lands hard on the rocks below. The demon's head gets knocked unconscious after feeling its body's pain. The Temple Demon's demise. Armed with a knife, Tanjiro finds the head unconscious but still alive and prepares to kill it. He rationalizes his decision by saying that killing it could save others but he remains hesitant about killing the demon, taking long enough for a man to appear behind him. The man tells him he cannot kill it with a knife, motioning Tanjiro's attention to a rock. Now forced to bludgeon the head repeatedly, Tanjiro freezes in the moment. The man catches his scent and believes he is too kind to even kill demons. The demon awakens and tries to grab Tanjiro; at that moment, the sun rises and the light burns the demon away into ash. He realizes that the demon is now dead from even little sunlight and runs to find Nezuko. He is relieved to see her inside the basket in the temple, safe from the sunlight. Sakonji Urokodaki meets Tanjiro. After burying the dead of the temple, the man introduces himself as Sakonji Urokodaki, and he surmises Tanjiro is the boy Giyu had sent for him. Tanjiro introduces himself and Nezuko but Sakonji cuts him off by asking what he will do if Nezuko devours someone. Shocked by the question, Tanjiro does not respond and is harshly slapped in the face, admonished for thinking too slow. Sakonji criticizes him for his hesitance to kill even a demon, telling him the proper response to if Nezuko kills someone is to kill her and then kill himself, ""That's what it means to travel with your sister who became a demon"". Tanjiro's test begins. Sakonji warns him it must never happen, to which Tanjiro now acknowledges the threat. He tests him to see if he is fit to join the Demon Slayer Corps; by carrying Nezuko and following him. In the middle of the day, Tanjiro chases after Sakonji, who is keeping a steady pace far in front of him. Wonder how old he is and how he is able to be so fast and create little footstep, Tanjiro struggles to keep up. He apologizes to Nezuko since she is being battered about inside the basket as he sprints, asking her to be patient and believing patience is all she had known. As the sun set, an exhausted Tanjiro has reached Sakonji's house at the foot of the mountain. Struggling to catch his breath, he asks if he had passed the test; to this, Sakonji only tells him the test will now begin and they will climb the mountain, causing Tanjiro to scream in shock. With Nezuko safe and asleep inside his hut, Sakonji and Tanjiro make their way up the mountain; the latter continuing to feel the exhaustion of his run and now feeling dizzy. Suddenly, Sakonji stops in his tracks and turns to Tanjiro. He instructs the boy to make his way down the mountain before dawn before vanishing. Though initially shocked, Tanjiro believes he can descend the mountain with his keen sense of smell before daybreak. As he runs down the peak, his optimism is quickly fades when he learns the mountain contains numerous traps within. After being injured by several, he realizes he won't make it down if he continues to get hit, and his problem is worsened by the mountain's thin air causing him difficulty in breathing. Tanjiro finishes his descent. Before embarking on his descent down Mount Sagiri, Tanjiro takes a deep breath to compose himself and isolate the scents of the mountain. With a clear path, he makes his descent and begins to avoid most of the traps. Despite being injured by one made with bamboo without the human scent he had been avoiding, he urges himself to continue for Nezuko's sake. As day breaks, Sakonji sees a battered and bloodied Tanjiro at his doorstep, who only mutters ""I...have...returned"" before losing consciousness. ""Yours truly, Giyu Tomioka."" Sakonji recalls the letter he was sent by Giyu. Giyu apologizes for his abrupt request to ask him train someone but tells him that Tanjiro wants to become a Demon Slayer, since he was brave enough to attack him. He adds his belief that Nezuko won't harm humans and that like Sakonji himself, Tanjiro possesses a keen sense of smell. Asking Sakonji to train him to be a swordsman, Giyu apologizes for this self serving request, before wishing him good will in his endeavours. Sakonji sees the exhausted and injured Tanjiro and accepts him as his student. ","Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko Kamado, Temple Demon, Sakonji Urokodaki, Giyu Tomioka"
3,Sabito and Makomo,"Before embarking on his journey to become a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro creates a journal to log his training for Nezuko to read, who is still asleep. As he worriedly looks at her, Sakonji tells him his training shall begin.","Demon Slayers have fought since ancient times. He explains that the Demon Slayer Corps is comprised of several hundred members, and though it isn’t recognized by the government, it has been active since ancient times. Sakonji goes on to explain demons to him; it is unknown how they first appeared but what is certain is their physical prowess and powerful regeneration. Some can shape shift and other have completely different powers entirely; the only way to kill them is with sunlight or using a special sword. Though humanity fights back against demons with their slow regeneration and higher mortality, they continue to do so to protect others. Sakonji explains that as a trainer among many, he will guide Tanjiro through his own path unique to get stronger using the mountain, and that he must attend the Final Selection held on Mount Fujikasane to become a Demon Slayer; he alone will decide if he is fit to enter the selection. After days of repeatedly descending the mountain, Tanjiro is now able to dodge and weave through most of the traps hidden, thanks to his greater strength and becoming more adept at detecting scents. Despite this, the traps continue to get more difficult and dangerous, with Sakonji now deploying them laden with knives and spikes. After being given a sword to simulate real battle conditions however, his movements become hampered and Tanjiro becomes caught in the traps again. For the next several days, Tanjiro is tasked with swinging his blade over and over again, throughout the day, with Sakonji increasing the difficulty each time. Then, he is explained the mechanics of swords. The blade is strong vertically, but is weak horizontal and can be prone to breaking. Sakonji demonstrate that applying force along the blade is the correct way to cut, as well as threatening Tanjiro severely should he break the blade. Sakonji deflects Tanjiro effortlessly. In the next lesson, Tanjiro is repeatedly felled by Sakonji, with the goal of teaching him to arise quickly in battle. Then, Sakonji instructs Tanjiro to charge towards him while armed with a sword; despite Tanjiro running at his full speed, he is flipped in the air effortlessly by the old trainer. Next, Tanjiro is taught a special breathing technique called Total Concentration Breathing, and Sakonji also explains he will then teach him all ten forms of Water Breathing. Told to take a deep breath to allow oxygen to flow throughout his body, Tanjiro takes a long inhale, only to be slapped in the stomach by Sakonji for his incorrect method. Next, he moves on to the forms to use while using Total Concentration, only to be repeatedly slapped again for being wrong and for not bracing his stomach. Later, Sakonji instructs him to “become one with the water”, which involves kicking Tanjiro off a cliff into a cold river. Six months have passed since his training has commenced and Nezuko still remains asleep. Though Sakonji had summoned a doctor to check on her, nothing is determined to be wrong with her. Scared that he may find her one dead morning, he worries for her wellbeing everyday. Tanjiro now makes his final instructed climb and descent of Mount Sagiri; he is able to traverse the harsh landscape and defeat the traps successfully. Tanjiro's task. All of the sudden, Sakonji informs him he has nothing more to teach to the boy, telling him his success is now up to him. Walking through the forest, he takes Tanjiro to a clearing, the site of an immense boulder adorned with shide. Sakonji tells Tanjiro that he will only allow him to enter Final Selection if he is able to slice it. Shocked at the monumental task, Tanjiro calls out to his trainer, but Sakonji leaves without saying anything else. Taking a stance in front of the boulder, Tanjiro tries to slice it in an initial attempt, which promptly fails. All by himself, Tanjiro recalls all the previous lessons he was taught by Sakonji and trains himself to get stronger. With the basic lessons in his journal, he practices them over and over again in an attempt to accomplish his goal. For six months, he repeatedly attempts to slice it without success, and Tanjiro drops his sword one day in exhaustion, his hands severely callused through swinging his sword incessantly in failure. Feeling hopeless because of his lack of gain in training for so long, Tanjiro yells out his frustration and urges himself to keep going. He is suddenly silenced by the appearance of a young swordsman atop the boulder, wearing a fox mask. The young man tells him that whining is inappropriate, while Tanjiro is stunned by his sudden and unexpected appearance. He leaps off the boulder and kicks Tanjiro, deflecting his sword with his own wooden blade. A swordsman attacks Tanjiro. The swordsman instructs Tanjiro to charge at him; when Tanjiro becomes worried since he has a real blade against his wooden practice sword, the young man only laughs at his concern and taunts him by thinking he had a chance of hitting him. He lunges at Tanjiro with incredible speed and informs the boy he is much stronger than him because he has sliced that boulder. He leaps into the trees and speeds around the forest in a display of his skills, before knocking Tanjiro to the ground. The swordsman admonishes Tanjiro for not mastering anything; in particular, the breathing techniques by Sakonji. Realizing that the stranger knows his trainer, Tanjiro is told he had only known the techniques as a fact and have never properly learned it, much less used it. As he attacks Tanjiro, the swordsman tells him to pound the lessons into his body to never forget them. Tanjiro responds by saying he has been trying for so long without making improvement but the swordsman responds by telling him the only way he can now go is forward. Commanding the boy to attack him again, Tanjiro sprints towards the swordsman with all his energy; his swing is promptly dodged and the swordsman slams his blade into Tanjiro’s chin, knocking him unconscious. With the boy on the ground unconscious, the swordsman mutters, “I’m leaving the rest to you"", as a young girl enters the forest. Makomo meets Tanjiro. When Tanjiro awakens, the girl asks if he is alright. Tanjiro tells her about the incredible strike he was dealt and how no movement was wasted by the swordsman. When he wishes to be as powerful as him, the girl tells him he can too since she will be looking after him, smiling gently as Tanjiro notes her pretty appearance. The girl’s name is Makomo, while the swordsman of earlier is named Sabito. Makomo corrects the mistakes and nuances Tanjiro has made to better his form. When asked where she is from, Makomo doesn’t respond, only telling him that she and Sabito love Sakonji dearly. Makomo teaching Tanjiro. Makomo and Sabito were raised by Sakonji after they were orphaned, and she tells him that there are other children like them, always watching him. Though confused by her strange, dreamy demeanour, Tanjiro is taught by Makomo the importance of Total Concentration Breathing; it accelerates both his blood circulation and heart rate, causing his temperature to spike and allowing him to match a demon’s strength while staying human. The vital lesson is to expand his lung capacity, in order to flood his body with air and allow his bones and muscles to gain strength. Confused at the mechanics of the technique, Tanjiro inquires how he can gain such power; Makomo only tells him, “Train to death”. Tanjiro prepares to face Sabito. Tanjiro works on expanding his lung capacity while swinging his sword, a laborious and painful task. Each time he spars with Sabito to improve his technique, the swordsman proves too fast to hit. Six months after meeting the two, Tanjiro and Sabito have a final match, with Sabito now armed with a real sword. As Makomo watches the two ready for their clash, Tanjiro announces that he will win this day. As he takes a long breath to strengthen himself, he notes that head-on battles are simple; the stronger and faster person wins. He and Sabito lunge towards each other but it is Tanjiro who makes the first swing, ending the fight. The boulder is sliced by Tanjiro. Tanjiro’s blade slices Sabito’s mask, which falls and reveals his face, curved into a relieved smile. Makomo sees this and smiles gently as well. She commends Tanjiro’s success and says a final message of advice: “Win, okay, Tanijro. Beat that guy, too?”. She and Sabito disappear from the forest in a haze, and Tanjiro realizes that his swing, believing had slashed Sabito's mask, has actually sliced the boulder in half. ","Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko Kamado, Sakonji Urokodaki, Sabito, Makomo"
4,Final Selection,"After a final spar with Sabito, Tanjiro has successfully attacked first and made the first strike. After slicing his mask in two, Sabito and Makomo are relieved at his triumph, commending his success before disappearing. The slash, that Tanjiro believed had reached Sabito’s mask, has actually sliced the boulder he was tasked with in half.","Sakonji sees the sliced boulder. Tanjiro realizes that his success was due to him finding his Opening Thread, which is a scent he detects and follows to help align the path of his sword to his target. Still in shocked at his accomplishment, he is suddenly met by Sakonji. He reveals he had no intention of sending him to attend Final Selection, unwilling to see more children die. He was certain the boulder was impossible to slice but is taken aback by his triumph and commends the boy, calling him ""a remarkable kid"". He pulls Tanjiro into a hug and asks that he come back alive from Final Selection. At Sakonji’s hut, Tanjiro is shocked by the large amount of food being cooked; Sakonji sees this as a celebration of his training paying off and tells him not to be shy. As he eats, Sakonji internally voices that he has nothing more to teach him, and that he will soon enter a world of hardships, but for now at least, he can rest easy. While Tanjiro cuts his long hair, Sakonji asks if he enjoyed the hot pot prepared for him, to which Tanjiro acknowledges his delight. He informs him that just like humans, demons eat to gain strength, and that a demon’s power is proportional to its number of devoured victims. Some devour humans to gain power, transform themselves and even use strange spells. Once his sense of smell sharpens, he will be able to determine the number of victims a demon has eaten. Afterwards, Sakonji provides him with a fox mask made by himself, with a charm to protect him from harm. In the morning, Tanjiro prepares to leave for Final Selection. Entering Nezuko’s room, he is saddened to see her still asleep and grabs her hand gently, telling her he will return no matter what. Sakonji tells the boy he has no worry, since he will take care of Nezuko while he is away. Bidding him goodbye, Tanjiro tells his trainer to say hello to Sabito and Makomo for him. Stunned by hearing their names, Sakonji wonders how Tanjiro knew the names of ""those dead children"". Final Selection of Mount Fujikasane By nightfall, Tanjiro has reached the foot of Mount Fujikasane, becoming amazed at the numerous wisteria flowers of the forest. Walking up the stairs to the meeting area, he is surprised to see numerous people his age also in attendance, all of them hoping to survive. The applicants are attended to by a pair of twins speaking as one. They thank everyone for joining and inform them of their goal. The forest contains demons imprisoned in the mountain, thanks to the wisteria around the forest trapping them in, since demons despise wisteria. The end goal is to survive for seven days in the forest to pass Final Selection. During the first day, Tanjiro has nothing but staying alive in mind, as he runs around the forest. He heads east to ensure he can reach sunlight but quickly detects a scent. Unsure of the location of the demon, he is answered when it leaps high above the forest and slams down into the ground, the impact forcing him back. Another demon emerges and clashes with Tanjiro, who manages to parry its claws but is launched back by the attack’s force. The two demons argue over who gets to kill and devour Tanjiro first, causing both of them to attack him at once. They knock Tanjiro back but he quickly regains his composure and begins to breathe deeply. The Hand Demon appears Using his acquired knowledge, he finds the Opening Thread and uses Water Breathing, Fourth Form: Striking Tide, successfully killing the two demons in one slash. As he praises himself for not letting the lessons go to waste, he remembers that his sword is the key to his success; Sakonji had explained that Demon Slayers wield a special weapon call Nichirin Swords. As he prays momentarily, he is disgusted by the sudden rotting scent in the air. He hears another applicant screaming in terror and yelling of his regret in joining; Tanjiro sees the commotion but becomes horrified at the sight of an immense, grotesque looking demon. Makomo becomes concerned for Tanjiro's life In the forest of Mount Sagiri, at the site of the sliced boulder, Sabito and Makomo converse about the boy they had taught. Makomo, with a worried expression, asks if Tanjiro is able to beat ""that one"". Sabito answers with uncertainty, saying it was never enough and that she knows it. The applicant is perplexed at the unannounced appearance of a morphed demon in Final Selection. The giant demon, made up of several green hands, has a dead applicant in his grasp, before opening his mouth and dropping the young man inside to devour. As the applicant and Tanjiro watch in horror, the demon gains strength and grows larger. When the applicant attempts to run, the demon meshes his arms into long appendages and grabs the fleeing boy. Before he can be devoured, Tanjiro composes himself from his initial fear and speeds forward to save him. Saying that unlike last time, he isn’t powerless anymore, he uses Water Breathing, Second Form: Water Wheel and cuts off the demon’s arms. The demon sees his fox mask and becomes delighted that ""another little fox has come to me"". When Tanjiro wonders what it means by another, the demon asks what year of the Meiji Era it is now. When Tanjiro answers it is now the Taisho Period, the morphed demon becomes infuriated and scratches himself in frustration, lamenting that time has now passed into a new period whilst he remains imprisoned. When he screams Sakonji’s name in anger, Tanjiro asks how he knows his trainer; the demon answers by saying that it was Sakonji who had imprisoned him on Mount Fujikasane 47 years ago. Tanjiro is surprised to learn it had lived for so long, while the applicant he had saved claims that no demon in Final Selection is that old. To this, the morphed demon states that while trapped in the forest, he has eaten 50 applicants of Final Selection, adding that he has personally devoured 13 students of Sakonji. Makomo killed by the Hand Demon As Tanjiro hears this in shock, the demon gloats about two in particular: one was a boy of strange hair color and was the most powerful of the ones he had faced, and another was a petite girl who lacked strength but was extremely agile. Horrified to learn that Sabito and Makomo were killed by this demon, Tanjiro reminisces that on his time training, as he saw and spoke to them. The demon goes on by saying that he recognized the texture of the fox masks as the ones on Sakonji’s own. Mocking the trainer’s warding masks, he gloats about saying that they never worked and that Sakonji might as well have killed his students himself. As Tanjiro listens, the morphed demon adds that when he told Makomo this, she flew into a rage and lost control of her emotions, leading him to rip her apart. Filled with rage, Tanjiro attacks head-on driven by intense emotion. Sabito, sensing that Tanjiro is attacking erratically, tells him to calm down and even out his breathing. When he attempts to slice directly in front of the demon, an arm punches him from the side, sending Tanjiro hurtling hard into a tree and breaking his warding mask. Seeing the unconscious Tanjiro about to be eaten, the applicant he has saved decides to move on and and flees. As the morphed demon moves in to eat him, he gloats about how Sakonji must feel that another student of his isn’t returning. Before Tanjiro can be grabbed, he is suddenly visited by a vision of his brother Shigeru, begging him to wake up. He regains consciousness in time and narrowly avoids getting taken, to the demon’s shock. Claiming he can now have some fun in battle, it grows multiple arms and attempts to grab Tanjiro, who runs throughout the forest and slices them off. Tanjiro realizes they grow back quickly, while the demon tells him that cutting his neck is the only way to kill him, remembering that even Sabito had failed to do so and was killed. Tanjiro attacks the Hand Demon Stopping in his tracks, he declares that to prevent more lives being sacrificed, he needs to kill the morphed demon. Tanjiro charges head-on once more; he detects a scent from underground and leaps upwards, while arms sprout from the ground to grab him. Seeing him in mid air, the demon morphs its arms into one long appendage to grab Tanjiro. A fearful Makomo worries that Tanjiro too will be killed by the morphed demon.

After gazing hard at each lump of ore, and using his keen sense of smell, the one Tanjiro chooses is...[1]","After learning the morphed demon is responsible for killing numerous applicants, including Sakonji Urokodaki's past students, Tanjiro attacks him to prevent more lives being taken by the powerful creature.

While still humanoid in form and strengthened by devouring several victims, the demon proved no match for the Demon Slayer. He was injured and fled the scene, only to be pursued by Sakonji, using his Water Breathing and incredible speed to sneak around the demon and defeat it. The demon sees Sakonji’s image in Tanjiro and becomes shocked seeing his archenemy once again. Decapitated, the demon’s head falls to the floor while his immense body begins to crumble to ash. He becomes angered that the last thing he will see is the face of a Demon Slayer. His soul finds himself in the afterlife, as the demon remembers his regret of devouring his brother soon after transforming. Tanjiro prays for the Hand Demon. Tanjiro approaches the demon’s fading body and sees a hand extended to him. Detecting the scent of sadness from the demon, he gently holds it, causing the morphed demon to cry. Despite its evil deeds, Tanjiro refuses to rebuke it and prays that the next time the demon is reincarnated, he doesn’t become a demon again. Amidst the dense fog, the morphed demon’s soul sees light behind him and runs towards it, reincarnated as a boy asking for his brother’s hand for comfort. With the death of the morphed demon, the souls of Sakonji’s past students are finally able to depart into the afterlife, including Sabito and Makomo. For the next several days, Tanjiro continues to traverse the forest of Mount Fujikasane in the hopes of asking demons about returning someone back into a human. Instead of answering him, the demons attempt to devour him, forcing him to kill them without gaining an answer. Exhausted, he stops to catch his breath but quickly senses the scent of wisteria around him. He finds himself back at the shrine of the mountain, with the other survivors of Final Selection. He is shocked to see only four of them have survived after the seven days, including one girl; he also laments not being able to see the applicant he had saved from earlier, believing he was killed because he was unconscious. The blond boy next to him becomes scared that he survived, as he believes he would die anyway. The survivors of Final Selection. The twins who welcomed them to the mountain appear again, congratulated the four on their success. The last boy rejects their applause and asks what becomes of their situation now, demanding his sword. They state that they will first be given their uniform and are assigned the rank of Mizunoto, the lowest of ten ranks in the Demon Slayer Corps. They will then choose the ore of their swords but are told they will actually receive it at a later date. At the signal of one of the twins, birds descend to meet the four. The survivors are given Kasugai Crows to assign them with new mission and for communication; the blond boy notices that he isn’t given a crow but a sparrow instead. Tanjiro intervenes. Enraged, the boy grabs the hair of one of the twins, to the shock of Tanjiro and the blond boy, demanding he be given a Nichirin Sword. Tanjiro intervenes and grabs his arm, threatening to break it if he doesn’t release his hold. When he implores him to try, Tanjiro tightens his grip, hurting the boy into releasing his hand. After the small scuffle, the four are presented with various ores for their sword to be made with. They are confused as they don’t know what to look for in choosing an ore, but it is Tanjiro who makes the first choice by sniffing a sample and selecting it. At an unknown location, a man is informed by a Kasugai Crow that five have survived Final Selection. He is delighted at the news and ponders what kind of Demon Slayers they would become. Sakonji embraces the siblings. As he returns to Sakonji’s hut, an utterly exhausted Tanjiro struggles to walk back, using a stick to support himself. He remembers that none of the demons he asked responded to his question and instead tried to kill him, without leaving him an answer to return Nezuko back into a human. As night falls, Tanjiro finally reaches Mount Sagiri. Unexpectedly, the door is kicked down and Nezuko walks outside. Relieved to see her, he tries to run but collapses in exhaustion. When he tries to get up, Nezuko runs to her brother and pulls him into a hug. Embracing his younger sister, Tanjiro cries and asks why she had suddenly slept for so long. Upon seeing the siblings, Sakonji warmly embraces them and is relieved that Tanjiro has returned alive, as tears fall from his mask. Inside, Sakonji is impressed to learn that it was Tanjiro who killed the morphed demon. He then explains that there are several kinds of demons. In particular, there are those that possess spells called Blood Demon Art, giving them supernatural abilities. Tanjiro asks if Nezuko’s long sleep is an example of one but Sakonji doesn’t believe it to be so. He hypothesizes that Nezuko’s long sleep is the alternative of devouring human flesh in order to recover. Several days later, a swordsmith appears and makes his way to Sakonji’s hut. He introduces himself as Haganezuka and states that he has forged the sword for Tanjiro Kamado. When Tanjiro informs him he is the recipient, the swordsmith ignores him and talks about the sword instead. When offered tea inside, he instead talks about the materials for a Nichirin sword, Scarlet Crimson Iron Sand and Scarlet Crimson Ore. He explains that the materials absorb sunlight and that they are found on a mountain that is bathed in sunlight all day long. Inside his hut, Sakonji hears the two and becomes annoyed that Haganezuka is once again ignoring others to talk about his swords. Haganezuka meets Tanjiro. He turns to see Tanjiro, shocking the Demon Slayer with his Hyottoko mask. Haganezuka calls Tanjiro a 'child of brightness'; confused, Tanjiro is told he is referring to his eye and hair color, believing that his family must work with fire and calling it lucky and cause for celebration. Tanjiro is surprised to learn about this fact, while Haganezuka believes that the sword will turn red for him. Tanjiro's blade becomes black Inside, Tanjiro is provided with his Nichirin Sword, while Haganezuka mentions that they are also known as 'Color Changing Swords', as they change color according to the user. Upon unsheathing his new weapon, the blade turns black. The result surprises both Haganezuka and Sakonji; Tanjiro becomes worried that it is a bad omen but Sakonji calms his concern by stating that black blades are simply uncommon. On the other hand, Haganezuka becomes infuriated since he hoped to see a bright red sword blade; he tackles Tanjiro and locks him in his legs, while Tanjiro becomes confused at his strange antics. At that moment, Tanjiro’s Kasugai Crow arrives and provides him with details for his mission. He must make his way to a town in the northwest, where young girls are reported to have disappeared. In the town, the newest victim has just been taken; a girl taken from her fiancé in the middle of the night unexpectedly.

6,Swordsman Accompanying a Demon,Sakonji sees Tanjiro off.,"After donning his uniform, Tanjiro prepares for his first mission as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. Sakonji gives him information now that he is a member. His uniform is made of a special fibre, making it waterproof and flame retardant, as well as strong enough to repel the claws and teeth of a weak demon. He also explains that so little is known about Demon Slayers with black Nichirin blades, it is believed that they don’t progress far. Despite this belief, Tanjiro reassures him that he will stop at nothing to turn Nezuko back into a human. Sakonji also provides him with a new box to carry Nezuko during day hours, made with new lighter wood and treated to have greater durability. As Tanjiro travels to his destination, he asks if Nezuko is fine in the back but isn’t responded to, realizing Nezuko is simply asleep to recover. After some time, he finds the town of the northwest region, the location of his mission. As he walks around, he catches sight of a dishevelled and dazed man. The townsfolk notice the man too, Kazumi, and pity him, as he was with the latest victim, Satoko, during her disappearance. Hearing the rumours of the townsfolk regarding the vanished girls, Tanjiro questions him. Kazumi accompanying Tanjiro. Kazumi takes him to the area where she disappeared, an alley in town. When he claims no one believes him, Tanjiro responds that he does, to his surprise, and begins his investigation. Using his sense of smell, he realizes that the area still contains the faint scent of a demon. As he watches the boy figuring out the situation, Kazumi remembers when he told Satoko’s parents; her father had beaten him severely for blaming her disappearance as her simply vanishing, to the anguish of Satoko’s mother. As they continue about the town, Tanjiro remains observant and sniffs around the area, to the confusion of the townsfolk. As the sun sets, Tanjiro reaffirms Kazumi’s words that she really did vanish, hence why he is here. Still searching into the night, Kazumi tries to dissuade Tanjiro from continuing his investigation at dark hours and pick up again during the day, but Tanjiro remains vigilant and continues to smell around the area, telling him that “those things” are only active at night. At first, Kazumi is initially surprised but realizes what Tanjiro is. In another part of town, a girl is told by her mother to stay indoors at night. But as she prepares to go to bed, something dark follows her through the floor of her house. While lying down to sleep, she wonders what became of the girls who disappeared. Without warning, her bedroom floor becomes a dark and swampy puddle and a pair of hands grab her from beneath. With her mouth covered, she is unable to scream and is pulled into the murky water. The Swamp Demon reveals itself. Suddenly, Tanjiro gets up and begins to run away, to the confusion of Kazumi. Tanjiro tells him the scent is now stronger and the demon is now around. He leaps into the air to run atop the roof tiles, with Kazumi stunned by his high jump and realizing that Tanjiro is indeed a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. Landing in another alleyway, he senses the demon’s presence and a woman’s scent. Determining where the scent is strongest, he stabs into the ground, causing a spray of swamp water to spurt out. He spots something in the water and grabs it, rescuing the young girl from the demon’s grasp. Tanjiro uses Eight Form: Waterfall Basin. Remembering Sakonji's words about a demon's abilities, Tanjiro realizes this one is capable of a Blood Demon Art. With the girl in his arms, he asks the demon on the whereabouts of the missing girl. The demon only grinds its teeth in response and returns into its swampy portal. Kazumi appears alongside him and wonders what he saw, as Tanjiro asks him to take the girl in his care. With Kazumi vulnerable, Tanjiro stands in front of him and looks about the area. He notes that even while it’s submerged, its scent isn’t masked. He detects the likely location to strike but becomes shocked seeing three demons now. He leaps into the air to evade their grab and uses Water Breathing, Eight Form: Waterfall Basin in retaliation. The progenitor Muzan Kibutsuji. Before leaving, Sakonji mentioned one final piece of information; there is only one demon whose blood is capable of turning someone into a demon, the progenitor. He was the first to become a demon, doing so over a thousand years ago, and he is known as Muzan Kibutsuji. Tanjiro’s attack fails to hit their weak spots and only causes minor damage, while the demons retreat back into their swamp. He notes that all three have the same smell and that demons don’t usually group together. With the realization he is fight three clones to save two people, he steels his resolve and prepares for battle, as well as remaining focused that he will asked them about Muzan and how to turn a demon back into a human. Sensing an incoming attack, he turns around and uses Water Breathing, Second Form: Water Wheel, but the cut is too shallow to cause severe damage. The Swamp Demon remembers devouring its victims. The two-horned clone retreats momentarily and reappears, cursing Tanjiro for interrupting his hunt; the demon claims that the girl is now 16 and will turn stale if she isn’t devoured in time, shocking Tanjiro and Kazumi. The one-horned clone appears behind them and calms its other self, claiming that it has already devoured several girls in the town in satisfaction. The first clone becomes angered and states it wants to consume more. Kazumi asks the demon to return Satoko to him, but their attention is drawn by the appearance of the third, three-horned clone. Nezuko intervenes. The one-horned clone remembers Satoko and showcases its collection of hairpins taken from past victims; upon seeing Satoko’s hairpin among them, Kazumi tears up with the realization she was devoured. Tanjiro, upon learning the missing girls are now dead, suddenly reminisces on the murder of his family and Nezuko’s transformation into a demon, becoming filled with rage. The third clone attacks him but Tanjiro slashes its arm off in anger, missing its neck again. It escapes and regroups with the two-horned clone, overwhelming Tanjiro. When it attempts to grab him, Nezuko emerges from her box and kicks it away. The one-horned clone is confused at why a swordsman is accompanied by a demon, as he and the two-horned clone back away. Nezuko turns to Kazumi and the girl and gently touches their heads, seeing her siblings Takeo and Hanako within them. While Tanjiro is initially confused by her action, he remembers that Sakonji had tried to hypnotize her into believing all humans are her family and must be protected, and to never forgive any demon who harms them. With this message, Nezuko sprints towards the clones and raises her leg for an axe kick.

7,Muzan Kibutsuji,"His mind made up, Tanjiro follows one of the demons into the swamp that spreads before him. Waiting for him there is...[1]","After nearly being overwhelmed by the Swamp Demon’s clones, Tanjiro is rescued by the intervention of Nezuko. Hypnotized into thinking all humans are to be protected from demons, she prepares to fight the clones along with her brother. The Swamp Demon attacks Nezuko. She attempts to kick the three-horned clone but it retreats before she can make contact. Before she can chase after it, Tanjiro calls Nezuko over to stop and regroup with him. While running to him, Nezuko is nearly grabbed by the two-horned clone; Tanjiro initially worries for her safety but she skilfully dodges the attack and reaches him. Remembering that as a demon, Nezuko isn’t weak enough to need protection from him, Tanjiro believes she can protect Kazumi and the girl while he goes after the demons. Before he can tell her, the two-horned clone emerges again and engages her in battle. With one clone distracted, Tanjiro decides to jump into the swampy portal to battle the other two. Telling Nezuko to protect the two bystanders, Tanjiro is answered by her sister with a nod, to his thankfulness. He jumps into the portal and finds himself in a dark, murky swamp, littered with the clothes of past victims. Enraged at the sheer number of innocent lives lost, he calls their crimes unforgivable but is spotted by the two clones. The one-horned clone taunts him for entering their domain and being disadvantaged, as they swim towards him. Tanjiro mutters not to estimate him as the thin air of Mount Sagiri has helped him fight with little oxygen. As they converge, he raises his sword to attack; seeing this, the clones retreat temporarily, swimming in physically impossible directions. Tanjiro uses Sixth Form: Whirpool. Despite seeing their skill at maneuvering in their lair, Tanjiro deems this irrelevant as all he needs to do is to attack them when they get close. Opting to use an attack that can utilize unsteady footwork and able to use a vortex in the water, he waits for the clones to come to him. As they close in ready to kill him, Tanjiro uses Water Breathing, Sixth Form: Whirlpool and slices the two clones simultaneously. After killing them, he quickly grabs something floating in the water but begins to feel the strain of holding his breath for so long and swims up to reach Nezuko. As the last clone battles Nezuko, it tries to hit her but she evades his blow and punches him hard in the chest, causing him to vomit blood. Noting how powerful she is, the clone believes she must have gotten much blood from Muzan. As he tries to form a portal to retreat into, she chases him and forces him away from his escape. As they continue to fight, the clone begins to get used to her simple attacks and manages to hit Nezuko, cutting her forehead with his claws. Dazed by the attack, Nezuko stands still to soak the pain, allowing the clone to charge in. But before he can kill her, Tanjiro emerges from the swamp portal and cuts off both of the clone’s arms. Muzan threatens the Swamp Demon. Held at sword point, the clone realizes that Tanjiro has already killed his other two selves. Tanjiro rebukes the Swamp Demon and angrily asks how many lives has he taken. The demon only responds that girls who get old begins to taste bad and claims they killed them for their own good. Enraged, Tanjiro slashes its tongue before it can keep talking. Trapped between the wall and the Demon Slayer, the demon is asked by Tanjiro for everything he knows about Muzan Kibutsuji. Upon hearing the name, the demon suddenly grows terrified. Though Tanjiro is shocked, he threatens the demon further and prods him for information. Tanjiro kills the Swamp Demon. The Swamp Demon responds he can’t tell him anything, and remembers when he was severely threatened by Muzan and told not to tell anyone anything about him, since Muzan is always watching him. He begins to repeat that he can’t say anything and becomes more erratic, as Tanjiro senses the fear in him. The clone grows him arms back and attempts to kill him, but the Demon Slayer decapitates him, killing the Swamp Demon for good. Tanjiro comforts Kazumi. Annoyed that he still has not gotten his information, Tanjiro runs to see Nezuko and finds her already asleep to heal. He apologizes for getting her injured and reiterates his promise to turn her back into a human. After putting Nezuko back in her box, Tanjiro walks to Kazumi and asks if he is alright. Kazumi retorts that he can’t be, with the knowledge that his fiancée is dead. He tells him to keep on living no matter how many people he has lost. Angered, Kazumi grabs his shirt and asks what someone his age could possible know about losing someone. Tanjiro gently holds his hand to release his grip and offers Satoko’s hairpin in the hopes of finding something in her, before departing. As Kazumi tears up seeing what remains of his beloved Satoko, he looks to see Tanjiro walking away and realizes that he too had endured something similar. Kazumi apologizes to the Demon Slayer for his harsh words and is waved goodbye in response; looking at his hand, he is shocked to see it so rough looking and realizes it was because of relentless training. Tanjiro entrusts the safety of the girl to Kazumi and leaves them as dawn breaks. As he walks through the town, he is hit with the reality that there are more like him that have suffered at the hands of demons, deeming Muzan Kibutsuji the cause and declaring that he will never be forgiven as he lives. Tanjiro is suddenly met by his Kasugai Crow and given details of his next mission in the district of Asakusa in Tokyo; he is shocked to learn that he must already travel again just after finishing his first mission. Asakusa, Tokyo. Upon reaching Asakusa, Tanjiro stares in awe at the bright lights enveloping the area at night, wondering how advanced cities have already become. Staring at the tall buildings and seeing a tram for the first time, he begins to feel dizzy. They enter an alleyway but promptly leave when they see a kissing couple; they run through the city but Tanjiro becomes overwhelmed by everything he sees. Eventually, the siblings reach the outskirts of Asakusa and stop at an udon shop; an exhausted Tanjiro then orders a bowl from the shopkeeper. After receiving his bowl, he prepares to partake in his meal but suddenly detects a scent. In shock, he gets up and drops his meal. Tanjiro begins to breathe heavily and looks at the city, taking his sword with him. As he runs to the source, he wonders why it has appeared so suddenly in the city. He reaches a busy street with heavy foot traffic but is able to run to the source. As he believes it might be Muzan Kibutsuji, he sees a man just in front is the one giving off the scent. Tanjiro grabs his shoulder and the man turns around, revealing his red, cat-like eyes. Realizing it is Muzan himself, Tanjiro prepares to draw his blade but hears the voice of a little girl and sees a child in Muzan’s arms. Muzan Kibutsuji in Asakusa. Startled to see him pretending to live as human, Tanjiro freezes in horror. Muzan calmly asks the boy if he can help him and is met by his wife, who asks what is the commotion about. Tanjiro becomes sickened by the woman and child’s inability to sense that Muzan is actually a demon. His wife asks if he has met Tanjiro before, but Muzan denies it, saying he had probably mistaken him for someone else. Muzan silently unsheathes his claws and slices a passerby in the neck so quickly, no one notices apart from Tanjiro. The man feels the pain from the cuts but suddenly begins to change, worrying his wife. His teeth become fangs and his eyes become dark red, scaring her. Tanjiro attempts to rush in and stop him but the newly transformed demon bites into his wife's shoulder, terrifying the surrounding crowd as Muzan silently watches.

8,The Smell of Enchanting Blood,"His pursuit of the scent leads him to Muzan Kibutsuji. Tanjiro attempts to strike him down. But Kibutsuji, with his ability to turn humans into demons, cause a commotion in the area. As Tanjiro desperately tries to get things under control, someone appears before him…[1]","In the middle of a crowd in Asakusa, a man has transformed into a demon and injured his wife. Before he can kill her, Tanjiro rushes in and stuffs his hood into his mouth. As the woman calls out to him, Tanjiro instructs her to slow the bleeding of her wound, informing others to help her get patched as he wrestles to control the demon. Muzan and his human family walk away, while Tanjiro can only watch helplessly as his enemy flees. He yells at the Demon Progenitor that he will never let him escape; hearing the threat, Muzan continues to walk away while being asked by his wife on Tanjiro's strange actions. Tanjiro promises to cut off his head and to never forgive what he’s done. Two demons appear to render their help to Tanjiro. Police enter the scene and Tanjiro calls for restraints to secure the demon. They ignore him and attempt to pull him off the man but Tanjiro is reluctant to release his hold on the demon. He is nearly beaten by the officers but they are distracted by the sudden appearance of flower petals and flowing patterns blinding them. It is a Blood Demon Art, Scent of Illusory Blood, Visual Dream. Tanjiro detects a scent he can’t determine but senses it is getting stronger. A demon approaches him, accompanied by a boy; she tells him he can still use the term “person” to refer to even demons. She lends him a hand to save the transformed man. After sensing her, Tanjiro attempts to state her identity as a demon but she reveals it on her own accord, as well as being a doctor and that she too wishes to take down Muzan. Muzan kills a drunkard for bothering him. Elsewhere, Muzan sends his family away in a taxi, claiming he has a business meeting to attend to. He also intends to talk to the police about the “disturbance”, brushing aside his wife’s concern about the situation. With his wife and daughter gone, Muzan enters an alleyway to walk through. While doing so, he accidentally bumps a drunk man with his brother and friend. He apologizes but the drunkard attempts to confront him for his expensive clothes. The man then talks about his pale skin and claims he looks close to dying, enraging Muzan. He raises a fist and brutally punches the drunkard into the wall, breaking his skull. Upon seeing his brother die before him, the other man attempts to punch Muzan but is swiftly kicked high in the air, vomiting blood and splattering on the floor as he lands. As the last person watches in horror, Muzan approaches her and gets close to her face. Terrified, the woman stays silent as Muzan menacingly asks if she considers his pale complexion looks unhealthy to her. He asks if he looks sickly and unnatural, as if he is about to die. He retorts that he is instead a living being close to perfection and raises a claw. Muzan brutally kills a woman with his blood. He pierces the woman’s skull and floods her body with an enormous amount of blood. As she squirms in pain, Muzan rhetorically asks what might happen if he continues to flood her body with his blood, answering himself by stating that the human body can’t withstand such a transformation, leaving its cells destroyed. The woman transforms into a demon-like creature but her cells dissolve before it finishes, causing her to melt into a mess of flesh and gore that burns into ash. Muzan summons two demon by his side and instructs them to bring him Tanjiro’s head, describing him as the Demon Slayer with hanafuda earrings. They immediately comply and leave him to do his wishes. Left by himself, Muzan suddenly becomes terrified and remembers a moment in his past; a memory of someone standing before him, a feared enemy raising his sword while also wearing hanafuda earrings. Tanjiro meets the female demon's assistant. Elsewhere, Tanjiro is admonished by the udon vendor for not eating the udon bowl he gave him. He immediately orders a new bowl and states that he will really eat it. The vendor asks Nezuko if she too will have one but Tanjiro interjects by asking for two bowls instead. After gobbling down his udon, they leave the vendor and continue to the city. As they walk, Tanjiro apologizes to Nezuko for leaving her behind suddenly, but she stops walking and looks on ahead. He sees that she is staring at the boy who accompanied the demon he met earlier, who claims he only waited under her orders. When Tanjiro claims he could have found her with his sense of smell, he responds by stating that she is hidden under a cloaking spell he can’t see. The boy inquires about Nezuko really being a demon as well, calling her an eyesore while doing so. Upon hearing this, Tanjiro angrily retorts that Nezuko was considered the beauty in their town and refuses to let him get away with what he said. Travelling through the city, they end up at an alley’s dead end. Tanjiro is still claiming that the boy is wrong about Nezuko’s appearance, only for him to walk through the wall, instructing him to do so as well. Tanjiro and Nezuko walk through the wall and find a house seemingly where the dead end is. Before entering the house, the boy quickly threatens Tanjiro should he offend the person inside in any way, claiming that though he has no care what happens to him, he only brought him to the house because the woman insisted. They enter in and Tanjiro finds the injured woman from Asakusa on a hospital bed, attended to by the demon from earlier. He apologizes to the demon for leaving her with the job and learns that the transformed man is still restrained in the basement. Tamayo introducing herself. Tanjiro wonders aloud if she struggles to treat injured people, only to be punched in the chest by the boy. He criticizes Tanjiro for believing that treating humans involves holding back their desire for blood, leading him to quietly apologize. Unbothered by the statement, the woman scolds her assistant for resorting to violence. She introduces herself to Tanjiro as Tamayo and states that the boy is named Yushiro. She answers that treating humans isn’t as unbearable to her as it might be to other demons, as she has changed her body considerably, including removing Muzan’s curse. She takes them to the living room and tells Tanjiro and Nezuko to get comfortable. She continues her statement by saying that by modifying their bodies, they only require small amounts of blood to survive, taking it from blood transfusion. Tanjiro realizes that is why he doesn’t smell anything different from the two despite them not being the obvious demons he has seen. Tamayo adds that Yushiro can get away with less than her as she is the one who transformed him. Seeing his surprised reaction, Tamayo tells Tanjiro that while it is usually Muzan who can transform people, she was able to turn Yushiro into one but only after 200 years. ""Don't ask a lady her age, you ill-mannered scoundrel!"" At this, Tanjiro incredulously asks how old she is, only to be jabbed repeatedly in the stomach by Yushiro for asking for her age. Tamayo threatens Yushiro if he hurts him again and he quickly complies while admiring her beauty. Tamayo says that she doesn’t intend to create more demons and only transforms people who are terminally ill or gravely injured, adding that she will still ask them if they wish to live as demons as well. Tanjiro senses that she is pure and honest and someone he can fully trust. Finally, he asks if it is possible to transform a demon back into a human. The Arrow Demon searches for Tanjiro. The two demons tasked with hunting Tanjiro find the alley where they walked through. One of them uses the eyes imbedded in his hands to follow his path, while the second demon asks if he has found them, playing with a temari while doing so. The Arrow Demon finds his footprints and notes that he is followed by two others. The Temari Demon becomes excited by the upcoming fight, feeling the blood Muzan has given her strength. Tamayo claims there is a way to return someone into a human. Upon hearing this, Tanjiro tries in close to receive the answer but Yushiro angrily flips him over for trying to get near Tamayo. Tamayo scolds him again for hitting Tanjiro, though he claims he merely threw him over his shoulder, not hit him. Tamayo tells Tanjiro that for any wound, there is medicine or treatment, and though she concurrently doesn’t know how to, she and Yushiro are dedicated to working on a method that may succeed. She gives him a task; to produce an elixir for treatment, she would need both blood samples from Nezuko and from demons as close to Muzan as possible. Due to Nezuko’s condition of sleeping to heal, Tamayo sees her as extremely rare and unique, since most demons cannot handle not eating for two years. She also explains that by demons close to Muzan, she means demons whose powers are similar to him, making it more difficult. The Arrow and Temari Demon appear. Tamayo asks if Tanjiro is willing to do her request; with the hope others too can be saved, Tanjiro complies. Tamayo smiles at his acknowledgement, causing Tanjiro to blush, though he immediately sees Yushiro’s anger at it. Suddenly, multiple temaris punch through the house, battering the interior and forcing everyone inside to duck for safety. They stop and fly back to their owner, the Temari Demon. As the Arrow Demon wonders how they plan to kill them, she answers, “Vindictively, of course!”. Their powerful presence startles both Tanjiro and Yushiro.

Using her temaris, she pummels the house, destroying the cloaking spell hiding it. Tanjiro and Yushiro are shocked by the appearance of their new foes, more powerful than he's faced before. The Temari Demon calls on her partner, Yahaba, to state what he senses; he deduces the hidden house is due to the work of a Blood Demon Art wielder adept at hiding objects. He also senses the presence of a demon accompanying their target, confusing him. As she becomes excited at the prospect of killing them, Yahaba chides his partner, Susamaru, for her immaturity and complains of dust on his kimono from the initial attack. She ribs him to stop whining, as they have found their targets anyway. Tanjiro sees it was her who has caused all the damage just through her temari. Yushiro sees her and wonders if she is a servant of Muzan. Susamaru destroys the house and decapitates Yushiro. Susamaru continues her assault and pummels the house with lightning speed, forcing everyone inside to duck for cover. One temari almost hits Yushiro, who stands in its way to protect Tamayo; the temari then swerves unnaturally and smashes into his head, beheading him. Horrified seeing his decapitated body, Tanjiro tasks Nezuko with protecting the injured woman from before and take her outside; Tamayo states the basement is safer instead. As she leaves to do so, Tanjiro stands up and observes Susamaru. He notes that she possesses a completely different scent to past demons; one that is thicker and far stronger. Susamaru sees him and declares he is the one Muzan wants dead. Tanjiro requests Tamayo leave as he is the one targeted but she instead asks that he fights without them in his concern, as they don't need protection as demons. Susamaru hurls a temari at him with incredible speed; Tanjiro watches and determines a form to defeat it. Tanjiro stabs a temari with Seventh Form: Drop Ripple Thrust, Curve. The fastest form at his disposal, he uses Water Breathing, Seventh Form: Drop Ripple Thrust, Curve and pierces the temari. Somewhat surprised, she nonetheless summons back to her and the temari slides of his blade on its own. He notes that the temaris move unnaturally without spinning, such as when it struck Yushiro. Tamayo watches as Yushiro heals his mouth and jaws to speak, complaining that he was right to not let themselves get involved with Tanjiro, since his blindfold technique isn't fully working still; he can only masks object and isn't able to completely hide their existence. Tanjiro realizes it was Yushiro's Blood Demon Art that inadvertently hid their attackers until they destroyed the house. Yushiro declares he despises anyone who ruins the time with him and Tamayo, and calls their act unforgivable. Susamaru hears his message and laughs at his babbling. Susamaru getting serious. She discards her kimono to fight more freely and reveals they must be honoured to be killed by her, a member of the Twelve Kizuki. When Tanjiro hears this, Tamayo explains they are demons that serve directly under Muzan. She grows two new pairs of arms and forms four new temaris to fight with, now enjoying the battle. She launches all six at the house, forcing Tanjiro to evade them all as one ends up cutting Yushiro's face. Tamayo tries to think if she can cast her spell now but sees Tanjiro would be affected to, while Yushiro needs more time to heal in order to attack again. Tanjiro gets overwhelmed by the greater number of temaris, which injures Tamayo and Yushiro upon striking them. As he wonders how he can defeat them to save the demons, he notices there are two demon scents present. Yushiro tells him to follow the arrows to determine and dodge their path. When Tanjiro states he can't see them, Yushiro irritably gives him a paper talisman imbued with his sight. Upon receiving it, Tanjiro sees that arrows appear to direct the path and trajectory of Susamaru's temaris. He thanks Yushiro for this new insight and sees that Nezuko has returned, asking she join him outside to battle their opponents. He tells her to deal with Yahaba while he fights Susamaru and she complies. Tanjiro uses Third Form: Flowing Dance. Susamaru declares she will bring Tanjiro's head to Muzan and launches all of her temaris. Tanjiro evades them and runs away as the temaris pursue him, waiting for Nezuko's mark. Nezuko finds Yahaba in the trees and kicks him repeatedly. The distraction causes the arrows to fade, stopping the temaris' movement. With his chance in sight, Tanjiro uses Water Breathing, Third Form: Flowing Dance; he cuts all the temaris in one fluid motion and quickly slices off Susamaru's arms right afterwards. Tanjiro asks Tamayo if these demons are closely related to Muzan, which she surmises must be true; he then declares that he will extract their blood for sure. Susamaru laughs at his intentions and implores Tanjiro to try and extract their blood. Yushiro warns him that if they truly are Twelve Kizuki demons, they will be more formidable that he's faced thus far. While Tanjiro steels himself for the upcoming confrontation, Yushiro implores to Tamayo that they should decoy Tanjiro and Nezuko and flee. She is horrified at his idea, causing Yushiro to quickly claim he was joking. The siblings face Muzan's servants As Nezuko clashes with Yahaba, he becomes irritated by the dust being kicked up and uses his arrows to launch her away from him. The Temari Demon heals her lost arms instantly as Tanjiro notes that she possesses faster regeneration than any demon from Final Selection. Launched away by Yahaba, Nezuko collides with Tanjiro while the Arrow Demon himself lands to the ground to join Susamaru. She hurls a temari and nearly hits the two, who barely dodge in time. Yushiro informs Tanjiro he need to deal with Yahaba first, while he, Tamayo and Nezuko will battle Susamaru. Nezuko suddenly sees her mother and brother Rokuta's images in Tamayo and Yushiro, invigorating her to fight. Saying he is counting on her, the siblings split up to confront their targets. Yahaba causes Tanjiro to miss. Tanjiro charges at Yahaba with the intent of extracting his blood to produce the treatment. He senses the Opening Thread but the demon uses his arrows to disrupt his footwork, causing him to miss. Using his arrows, he flings Tanjiro throughout the surrounded area, causing him to slam into the trees and into the ground hard. Yahaba launches him high into the air and disables his arrow to drop the Demon Slayer to his death; in the nick of time, Tanjiro uses Eight Form: Waterfall Basin to stop his momentum and save himself. Susamaru launches her temaris at Nezuko, who evades them all successfully. She turns around to see Yushiro but he suddenly vanishes from view. While invisible, he strikes the Temari Demon with multiple punches and chops, bringing her to her knees. He reveals himself and curses her for hurting Tamayo, deeming her unforgivable. Yahaba overhears his threats and realizes that Tamayo is a fugitive from Muzan. Susamaru gets up and concurs his idea of taking her as well, before launching another temari at Nezuko. Nezuko is injured by a temari. She attempts to kick up but Tamayo and Yushiro warn her not too; they are too late and the temari breaks off Nezuko's right foot. With her opponent downed, Susamaru kicks her hard and sends the young demon hurtling into the house. She excitedly asks her partner if four heads would be great to take to Muzan; Yahaba disagrees and sees value in only Tanjiro and Tamayo. Inside, Tamayo sees the bleeding of her lost foot isn't slowing and gives her a serum to accelerate her healing; while doing so, Nezuko again sees her mother's image in the demon. Tanjiro continues to face the Arrow Demon but notices that even sensing the Opening Thread is pointless unless he can strike with pinpoint accuracy. Yahaba sends multiple arrows at him, forcing the Demon Slayer to evade them all. He tries to cut the arrows with his blade but making contact only take him to the arrow's path, slamming him into a wall. In pain, he drops his sword and sees an arrow wrapped around his arm to twist it off. Thinking quickly, he runs up a tree to be mid-air when the arrow spins his arm, saving himself. After recovering his sword, he hears Yahaba commending him for evading his attack, while realizing he needs to change the arrows path without touching them. Yahaba is defeated. Now enraged, Yahaba prepares his final assault, launching numerous arrows to kill Tanjiro. He quickly thinks of an idea: use the Sixth Form to trap the arrows and the footwork of the Third Form to close in on the Arrow Demon. As they converge on him, Tanjiro twists himself into a combined attack, Twisting Whirlpool-Flowing Water. With his arrows being spun around, Yahaba loses focus. Tanjiro, despite the heavy weight of the combined attack on his sword, gets close to him and uses Second Form: Improved, Lateral Water Wheel to decapitate the Arrow Demon. ","Susamaru, Yahaba, Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko Kamado, Yushiro, Tamayo"
10,Together Forever,"After forcing his arrows to bend to his own path and closing the distance, Tanjiro successfully decapitates the Arrow Demon Yahaba. He comments that while the Whirlpool loses force while it's not underwater, the arrows gave it extra power. Yahaba curses Tanjiro for defeating him as all he wanted to do was bring his head to Muzan and gain his approval. He becomes enraged at his head touching the dirt and declares he will kill Tanjiro as he dies.","Tanjiro caught in Yahaba's final attack. Using multiple arrows, he grabs Tanjiro's body and throws him towards a wall at high speed. Tanjiro realizes the arrows are stronger than before and uses Water Breathing, Fourth Form: Striking Tide to stop the attack from splattering him against the wall. As he lands, he is pulled by another arrow high into the air, quickly using Second Form: Water Wheel to stop the momentum. He is grabbed by another and pulled towards the house, utilizing Eight Form: Waterfall Basin to stop his descent. Yahaba relentlessly continues his last stand, forcing the Demon Slayer to then use Water Surface Slash, Drop Ripple Thrust, Curve and Whirlpool continuously to save himself. Using so many forms consecutively saps Tanjiro's energy but the Arrow Demon continues his assault while he fades into ash. Tanjiro continues to use various Water Breathing forms to save himself from the arrows until Yahaba finally disintegrates for good. Upon his death, the arrows disappear, causing Tanjiro to plummet to the ground. Exhausted and injured, he is too weak to even grip his sword but Tanjiro is determined to reach his allies and defeat the Temari Demon, biting his sword and crawling to them. As Susamaru continues the fight, she uses her temaris to kick up a dust cloud to hide herself. Yushiro tries to hide himself in the cloud but Susamaru sees where the dust is being moved as he runs through. She quickly hurls a temari at the demon; Yushiro is nearly hit but is saved by Nezuko deflecting it with her healed foot. He admonishes Nezuko for rashly attacking but she sees her brother Rokuta's image in him, patting Yushiro's head to his chagrin. Susamaru hurls another temari but Nezuko kicks it to stop its momentum. Yushiro watches Nezuko's sudden power and asks Tamayo on what she did. Nezuko and Susamaru trade kicks. Annoyed at thinking she can use her own attacks against her, Susamaru kicks a temari at the young demon, who returns it with considerable force. The two trade kicks and launch the temari back and forth at each other, kicking harder and harder as the temari gains considerable force each time. Tamayo explains that she only used a healing serum on Nezuko, which doesn't increase power. Instead, they are witnessing Nezuko's own strength increasing without even consuming blood. Eventually, Nezuko kicks the temari hard and fast enough to force even Susamaru to dodge its path to safety. Despite this, Tamayo knows that should Susamaru utilize her true potential, Nezuko would be defeated too; she looks at her arm and thinks of a plan. Tamayo confronts Susamaru. Somewhat impressed, Susamaru calls Nezuko an ""amusing little girl"" and prepares to go all out. Before she can, Tamayo stands in front of Nezuko and talks to her. Susamaru dismisses her as the fugitive but Tamayo asks if she knows about Muzan's true identity, shocking the demon. Tamayo explains that Muzan is nothing but a coward in constant fear, angering the Temari Demon. She continues by saying the reason demons don't form groups is to prevent them from banding together to attack him, and Muzan himself manipulates demons into acting like this, like her. Susamaru curses Tamayo for insulting Muzan; and as he watches the confrontation, Yushiro sees Tamayo's arm bleeding. Tamayo uses Magical Aroma of Daylight to lure Susamaru. Susamaru raves about Muzan's incredible power and declares he isn't petty enough to do such a thing, but while doing so, she says Muzan's last name. Upon realizing, she grows horrified at what she has done; Tamayo raises her arm to reveal her Blood Demon Art and tells her what she's done, trigger the curse. Yushiro sees she has used Magical Aroma of Daylight, a potent spell that weakens a target's brain function. rendering them unable to lie or keep secrets. Seeing the distressed demon, Tamayo says she pities Susamaru but nonetheless farewells her. Susamaru is harmed by Muzan's curse. Susamaru runs away and begs for forgiveness from Muzan but her body begins to change. She hunches over in pain as Tanjiro crawls to the scene, watching what is happening. Without warning, giant demonic arms rupture out of Susamaru's body and mouth. As Tanjiro, Tamayo and Yushiro witness the scene in horror, the arms begin to brutally destroy Susamaru's body. After the carnage, they look at what remains of the Temari Demon; Tanjiro asks if she is dead but Tamayo explains she is still yet to die and will do so momentarily. She states that is the effect of the curse and she was killed by Muzan's cells still inside her. She goes on by saying that while demons are normally unable to harm each other, Muzan alone is capable of destroying demon cells. Suddenly, Yushiro runs over to Tanjiro and pushes a cloth to his nose, warning him not to inhale Tamayo's spell, being harmful to humans, while Tanjiro acknowledges. Tamayo calls over Tanjiro and shows that Susamaru isn't one of the Twelve Kizuki. She explains that they have a number engraved on their eyeballs but points to Susamaru's detached eye and notes that it doesn't possess one. She surmises that Yahaba also didn't have one and believes they are too weak to be true members. Stunned by her statement of them being too weak, Yushiro adds that they were stupid demons, admonishing Susamaru for hurting Tamayo and claiming she deserved her demise. Nonetheless, Tamayo extracts a vial of her blood, hoping it may prove useful regardless. She then leaves to tend to Nezuko, who had accidentally inhaled her spell; Yushiro, unwillingly to leave her, runs away and leaves Tanjiro on his own to assist Tamayo. Tanjiro gives Susamaru her last temari. Tanjiro suddenly hears a voice: a girl asking for a temari. He hears it coming from Susamaru's remains and kindly places her last temari next to it. The voice asks to play with him while Tanjiro sadly notes that despite murdering numerous people, she was still a little girl. The sun then rises to a new day; as Susamaru's remains and blood burn away, Tanjiro laments that she was manipulated into thinking she was of the Twelve Kizuki, manipulated and compelled to fight just to be killed by a curse. He finds no salvation in her fate, as nothing will remain of her and death is the price she paid for killing others. He blames her demise on Muzan and asks if this is how he treats even those who worship him, deeming him, ""a true demon"". With the sun up, the demons have moved to the house's basement. Tanjiro walks down to see them and finds Nezuko all healed. She quickly hugs him in relief but unexpectedly turns to hug Tamayo as well. Yushiro becomes incensed at her touching Tamayo but she brushes aside his concern and states she does not mind. At this, Yushiro denies what he just said and says Tamayo is kind-hearted, while noting her beauty. Nezuko also begins to pat Yushiro's head gently, annoying him. Tamayo comments that Nezuko had been behaving like this since waking up and is worried for her; Tanjiro calms her concern and states she probably thinks of them as members of her family. A thankful Tamayo hugs Nezuko. Surprised, Tamayo notes that Nezuko is bound to believe that all humans are family, not demons. Tanjiro explains that Nezuko simply sees them as humans. He comments that he was initially hesitant to let Nezuko get put under a spell but seeing she retains her own will, he does not mind now. Tamayo suddenly begins to cry; shocked, Tanjiro quickly apologizes and begs Nezuko to stop hugging and move away from her. Instead, Tamayo pulls her in closer and tearfully thanks the little girl, showing resentment for her demonic nature. Yushiro remembers meeting Tamayo. Seeing her vulnerable, Yushiro remembers when he was found by Tamayo whilst terminally ill. She asks if he is willing to become a demon as his illness will soon kill him, but adds that as a demon, he will lose his humanity, causing him pain and grief. Asking the boy again, Yushiro weakly turns to see Tamayo. Tamayo states that having come close to Muzan, she and Yushiro will leave the region. They must conceal themselves again soon or face another risk. She also states that despite hiding her identity, working with people as a doctor, some can determine her true nature as a demon. Tamayo asks if Tanjiro is willing to let them take Nezuko in, while Yushiro shows his disapproval. Though Tanjiro knows she will be safer not engaging in battle, he thanks her for her concern but states they will be staying together, unwilling for them to be apart. Having received her answer, Tamayo wishes them good fortune in battles to come, while Yushiro bluntly states they must now erase all traces of themselves, asking them to depart now. Tanjiro returns the sentiment to the demons. As Nezuko runs away, he chides his sister for running away but is called upon by Yushiro; he admits that Nezuko is a beauty, causing Tanjiro to laugh at his final acknowledgement. A Demon Slayer begs a woman to marry him. Outside, his Kasugai Crow repeatedly directs him to a new mission south-southeast, constantly nagging the Demon Slayer with its continuous instructions. Suddenly, they hear a loud ""Please""; they turn to the source and find a yellow-clad Demon Slayer harassing a woman into marrying him, claiming he can die any time and begging her to do so, as Tanjiro watches the unusual scene in surprise.

11,Tsuzumi Mansion,"On the way, Tanjiro runs into his fellow Final Selection survivor, Zenitsu Agatsuma. Tanjiro has to put up with Zenitsu’s pessimistic attitude, as they make their way deep into the mountains. Then, they encounter two children whose older brother had been taken away from them in front of a mansion. Zenitsu notices the ringing sound of a tsuzumi drum…[1]","Tanjiro admonishes the Demon Slayer. While travelling to his next mission, Tanjiro encounters another Demon Slayer as he begs a woman on the footpath to marry him. He is met by the guide bird accompanying him, a sparrow, who informs him of what has happened. He pulls him off the woman’s clothes and questions his actions. The Demon Slayer recognizes Tanjiro as a fellow survivor of Final Selection. Tanjiro loudly claims he doesn’t know who he is, but suddenly remembers him as the one who doubted he would survive. Tanjiro clears the situation with the woman, but when the Demon Slayer pesters her again, she repeatedly slaps and rebukes him. She tells him all she did was check on him as he was ill-looking on the side of the road, and that she clearly doesn’t love him since she already has a fiancé. The Demon Slayer asks aloud why he got in his way, only for Tanjiro to look at him with a disappointed and unnerved expression. When he doesn’t say anything, he claims he will die soon and that Tanjiro would need to protect him till he gets married. Instead, Tanjiro introduces himself and the Demon Slayer states his name is Zenitsu Agatsuma. Tanjiro shocked at Zenitsu's cowardice. Tanjiro asks why Zenitsu claims the way that he is and questions why he became a swordsman. Zenitsu replies that he was deceived out of all his money by a woman and racked up debt. The person who took him was an old man who turned out to be a trainer. After hellish training, he claims the experience he felt it was so bad he willingly entered the Final Selection to die. Despite surviving, he continues to experience hell every day since and shows his great fear of dying at the hands of a demon to a shocked Tanjiro. After calming down, the two travel to Tanjiro’s next mission. Saying he is hungry, Zenitsu is given an onigiri by Tanjiro. After taking a bite, he asks if Tanjiro is hungry too. Tanjiro says that it is all he has, leading Zenitsu to split it in half for him. While walking, Tanjiro states that while he can respect his fear of demons, Zenitsu can’t use it to trouble his sparrow. Zenitsu wonders how he knows and Tanjiro mentions that his sparrow had said that he whines during each mission, beckons the attention of girls and snores loudly. He is stunned to learn that Tanjiro understood his sparrow but is interrupted by Tanjiro’s Kasugai Crow instructing them to begin running, causing Zenitsu to freak out over seeing a talking bird. Tanjiro and Zenitsu find the mansion. Making their way through a forest, Zenitsu tries to avoid going to the location and claims he is tired and will be useless anyway. On the other hand, Tanjiro is focused and senses the demon’s scent getting stronger. In a clearing, they find their mission's location, a large woodland mansion. Tanjiro says he can smell blood and another strange scent. Though Zenitsu cannot smell it, he asks if Tanjiro can hear a strange sound. Tanjiro looks around and finds a pair of siblings near by. When he approaches them, they back away, clearly frightened. To calm their nerves, he shows them Zenitsu’s sparrow. Slightly more relieved, Tanjiro asks if they live in the mansion. Instead, the boy claims the mansion belongs to a monster, adding that their oldest brother was taken from them. They encountered the monster at night and followed their brother’s trail of blood to the mansion, as he was injured. Tanjiro reassures them they will defeat the monster and bring their brother back. Zenitsu then asks if Tanjiro can hear something, a creepy sound like a tsuzumi. Though he cannot hear it, he and Zenitsu look at the mansion’s open window. Suddenly, a bloodied and injured man flies out of the window, landing hard on the ground in a pool of blood and startling everyone. Tanjiro rushes to his aid but the man dies of his wounds moments later. At that moment, an ominous tapping sound erupts from the mansion, scaring the children, Zenitsu and steeling Tanjiro’s resolve. The boy comforts his sister by remembering that their brother wore a different colored kimono to the dead man's. The children enter the mansion against instructions. Tanjiro calls on Zenitsu to join him inside the mansion but he vehemently refuses. Annoyed, Tanjiro decides to move on but gives him a spiteful look, causing Zenitsu to reluctantly join him. He leaves Nezuko’s box in the care of the children and the Demon Slayers enter the mansion. When Zenitsu asks if he will be protecting him, Tanjiro answers that he is still injured from his previous mission. He becomes startled that he will die with him injured. Tanjiro attempts to calm him down but sees that the children have entered the mansion as well, scared by scratching noises in the box. Dismayed they left Nezuko alone, he tells them it is too dangerous in the mansion but is accidentally bumped into Zenitsu frightened by the mansion shaking. Tanjiro sees the giant demon. Before they regroup, the beat of a tsuzumi changes the rooms they’re in, separating Zenitsu with the boy and Tanjiro with the girl. Each beat changes the location Tanjiro is in until he ends up in a large room. Separated from her brother, the girl cries but Tanjiro gently comforts her, saying she is protected and Zenitsu will protect her brother. Asking for her name, she answers her name is Teruko. Tanjiro suddenly detects a scent and sees an immense demon walking by them, with tsuzumis embedded in its body. He senses that it is the strongest one in the house and surmises it must have devoured a great number of victims. The unknown swordsman sees Zenitsu. Zenitsu becomes terrified that he is separated from Tanjiro, clutching onto the boy for comfort. The boy admonishes him for acting so frightened with a sword on his belt, shocking him. Nonetheless, he tries to drag him out so to escape the mansion but finds that the door leading outside now opens to a different room. He tries opening multiple doors but ends up finding a room with a person inside, wearing a boar mask. The unknown stranger excitedly yells and leaps out of the room, frightening Zenitsu into hysterics. After he leave, Zenitsu is left with Shoichi’s disappointed expression. Seeing the giant demon in front of them, Tanjiro instructs Teruko not to scream. The demon curses about “them” ruining his hunt and losing his prey. Tanjiro draws his sword and prepares to attack the demon, introducing himself, his rank and declaring he will kill them. He tries a straight frontal lunge at the demon but is thwarted when the demon beats the tsuzumi on its body, causing the room to turn sideways. The unknown swordsman prepares to fight. As he sees that the shifting rooms are its Blood Demon Art and the mansion is his domain, Tanjiro suddenly senses a new scent that isn’t a demon. Bursting through the wall is the stranger from earlier. After seeing the boar mask, he notices him wielding a pair of serrated Nichirin Swords. The stranger declares he will kill the monster and get stronger, preparing to attack with the phrase “Comin’ through!”.

In retaliation, the demon taps a tsuzumi, causing the room to turn sideway and evade the attack. As it does, Teruko lands hard on the upside down ceiling. Tanjiro instructs her to hold onto furniture but is hit by the masked stranger using him as a springboard to leap from. Annoyed, he tells him to focus on the demon, not his own reckless attacks.","The Drum Demon's claw attack The demon taps its drum twice, spinning the room right-side up again. Teruko lands on the floor but is stepped on by the masked Slayer, finding enjoyment in the rotating rooms. Seeing this, Tanjiro angrily grabs his leg and flings him away, cursing him for hurting a little girl. In response, he claim no person has ever thrown him like that and attacks Tanjiro with their swords. As he backs away, Tanjiro wonders why he is being challenged by a Demon Slayer. The stranger tells him his swords will hurt him, as they rip flesh to his liking. Tanjiro tries to remind him of the threat of the demon but he charge at him regardless. Infuriated by their presence, the Drum Demon taps the tsuzumi on his stomach, causing giant claw marks to slice in front of Tanjiro and the masked Demon Slayer. The older brother is found The demon begins to attack and rotate the rooms simultaneously; as he spins, Tanjiro begins to see the pattern between the tsuzumis and their respective movements. But as he begins to get used to them, the demon begins uttering something, causing the rooms to change instead. Losing track of the demon in a new room, Tanjiro suddenly detects the scents of multiple demons within the mansion. He then detects the smell of blood; he opens a nearby door, looks into the hallway and finds a corpse. Shocked to find another lost life, he leads Teruko in another direction. While making their way down the hall, he detects a new scent; Tanjiro opens the door and finds the children's lost older brotherholding a tsuzumi. Elsewhere, a terrified Zenitsu holds his companion Shoichi's hand as they walk through the dark hallways. Already on edge, he becomes more scared when the boy suddenly asks him a question. He angrily scolds him for causing him a fright and for not signalling when he was about to speak, claiming he would be branded a murderer for causing his heart to leap out of his mouth. Shoichi, tired of dealing with Zenitsu's cowardice, mentions he has been shivering and sweating for some time now. He says that him being fearful in turn causes him to be nervous; apologetic, Zenitsu exclaims they need to be quiet so as to not attract demons, though yells while doing so. The Tongue Demon appears Suddenly, Shoichi looks at something behind the Demon Slayer and becomes scared. Zenitsu turns around and sees an approaching demon excited to see them. They run away but the monster gives chase; Zenitsu claims that they taste bad but the demon wants to taste them first, using its long tongue to attack. They are followed into a room, bursting through the wall while doing so. Zenitsu begs the child to make a run for it, claiming his fear is now in his knees. Despite not wanting Shoichi to die young, he struggles to find the courage to fight. The demon then enters the room with them and fear finally overwhelms Zenitsu, knocking him unconscious. Shoichi is stunned to see the Demon Slayer asleep, now cornered by the demon. The demon uses its tongue to try and grab him as the boy desperately yells for Zenitsu to wake up, causing his hand to twitch slightly. Without warning, the demon's tongue fall off at the tip; as the demon becomes shocked by the sudden pain, Zenitsu stands up, to the demon and Shoichi's wonder. Zenitsu kills the Tongue Demon with First  Form: Thunderclap and Flash The Demon Slayer takes a stance and begins to breathe; the creature looks on, confused at the unexpected and strange sound but notes that he feels different now. Zenitsu unsheathes his sword and uses Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash, rushing forward at lightning-fast speed and decapitating the demon instantly. After his strike, he suddenly snaps awake again, just as the defeated demon's head rolls next to him. He reacts with terror and sees the demon is already dead to his surprise, believing and thanking Shoichi for defeating the demon, much to his bewilderment. While travelling through the hallways, the masked Demon Slayer irritably recalls when the Drum Demon had just launched him away, remembering it has been three days of battling it like this. Upon reaching a turn, a hand attempts to grab him but he flip back to safety in the nick of time. A heavy-set horned demon appears, calling him a fresh human and wanting to devour him. The unknown Demon Slayer uses Third Fang: Devour The swordsman readies himself by breathing using a self taught technique; Beast Breathing. As the demon steps forward, he quickly slash off its arms and lunge forward, using both blades in the move Third Fang: Devour and easily slicing off the demon's head. Using the corpse to leap from, the Demon Slayer launches himself with a push and proudly continues his way through the mansion. The Drum Demon continues to mutter about wanting to devour someone with Marechi blood, stating it is worth devouring a hundred people. Upon doing so, the demon says he can then reclaim his place among the Twelve Kizuki, revealing his former place of Lower Rank Six. He remembers when he was found by Muzan in the mansion, who addressed him by his name Kyogai. Muzan sees the corpse he was devouring is unfinished and asks if he is done eating. Kyogai asks Muzan for another chance. Kyogai denies this but has his engraved eye slashed by the Demon Progenitor. Kyogai begs for more time but Muzan refuses, stripping him of his rank. Kyogai reminisces on when he first received power from him; the incredible power of his blood left him in awe and he remembers when he first claimed his role among the Twelve Kizuki to devour more humans and get stronger, or so he believed. Teruko rushes to her brother Kiyoshi and hugs him in relief. Tanjiro approaches them and introduces himself to the elder brother. He asks to see his wound; Kiyoshi shows his injury but begins crying from the pain. The Demon Slayer then excitedly reveals ointment he was provided with from Sakonji, while commending the boy for his survival. After patching his wound, Tanjiro asks what had happened; Kiyoshi reveals he was dragged away by a monster, Kyogai, and nearly devoured. He was unexpectedly rescued when more demons appeared and argued over who gets to devour him; the Tongue Demon and Horned Demon. During their scuffle, the Horned Demon had ripped off a tsuzumi from the Drum Demon's back. Kiyoshi picked it up and tapped it, causing the room he was in to change. Kyogai finds Tanjiro Tanjiro remembers Kyogai kept referring to him as ""Marechi""; his Kasugai Crow answers that Marechi refers to someone with rare blood; explaining that human blood has different rarity and value to demon. Someone with rare blood is more valuable as they can be worth fifty or even a hundred people if devoured. As Tanjiro and the children hear this unsettling piece of information, he senses Kyogai approaching them. Tanjiro informs the children he must leave the room to battle him and instructs Kiyoshi to strike the tsuzumi as he leaves; he promises to find them after the battle and tells them to hold on for a little longer. With Kyogai in sight, he rushes out of the room and gives the signal; Teruko strikes the tsuzumi and changes the room to protect him and his sister. Kyogai spots the Demon Slayer and taps twice, flipping the room upside down; however, Tanjiro is able to predict the change and lands safely on the ceiling. Kyogai repeatedly strikes his tsuzumis to disorient his opponent but Tanjiro remembers the specific movements of each one and moves according to anticipate the change. Despite being flipped throughout the room, Tanjiro stays in sync and lunges at Kyogai, but is forced to stop his attack when Kyogai nearly kills him with his central tsuzumi's claw attack. Tanjiro remembers that despite Tamayo patching his injuries, they have not healed since his last mission. He questions himself on whether he can defeat the demon, as the pain causes him to struggle staying up. When he confronted Zenitsu earlier and yelled at him, the pain was at its worst but he continues to endure it, only able to soak it up because he is the eldest sibling. As Tanjiro lands down to soak up the discomfort of continual movement, Kyogai attacks him again, forcing him on the move once more. He notes that not being at full strength causes the pain to make him stumble, leaving him vulnerable to the claw attack. Looking for help, he remembers Sakonji's advice on Water Breathing. Water can change into anything; it can take any form, can smash boulders and flow forever. With ten different forms, he can adapt to keep on the move even while injured. Tanjiro encourages himself to continue. He remembers Zenitsu's words that a ""broken Tanjiro's not gonna do any good""; annoyed at his statement, Tanjiro pushes himself to keep looking forward. He urges himself to give his all and stands up to battle the Drum Demon. He has survived until now and has what it takes to keep going. Raising his sword at the enraged demon, he vows that, ""Even if I am broken, I'll never give up no matter what!"".

13,Something More Important Than Life,Zenitsu and Shoichi realize they are lost.,"Despite his injuries hampering him and Kyogai's endless waves of room rotations, Tanjiro urges himself to keep fighting, unwilling to lose everything he has been fighting for till now. Elsewhere, Zenitsu and Shoichi continue to wander the halls searching for a way out of the mansion, with the former worrying about Tanjiro's safety and the continual creepy sound through the mansion. Shoichi notices that they have seemingly been walking around in circles, with which Zenitsu concurs. As they look around for a door, the hallway flips forward, causing the two to fall down and eventually land back outside through an open window. Kyogai continues his assault, manipulating the room to disorient his adversary and sending waves of slashes in an attempt to kill him. Tanjiro, still feeling the pain of his previous mission, can barely survive the onslaught; he is nearly killed when the room turns forward, leaving him hanging by a light fixture and vulnerable to the slashes till he dodges them in time. Kyogai, irritated by his refusal to die, repeatedly attempts to wear him down, still wanting to devour his target. Tanjiro calls out to the demon and asks for his name; Kyogai responds, and the Demon Slayer calls out that he will not surrender Kiyoshi over to him. Tanjiro's unwillingness to quit reminds the demon of a moment in his past when someone told him to quit. Wanting to reclaim his place among the Twelve Kizuki, Kyogai speeds up the rate of his attacks, spinning the room entirely and causing numerous slashes to rip through. Kyogai's human life. In his anger, he remembers when a musician in his past had denounced his songwriting as boring and uncultured. He insulted his hobby as a waste of pens and paper and mocked him for always being a shut-in indoors while playing his tsuzumis. Kyogai, having hidden that he was already a demon at that moment, unleashes a slash from his central tsuzumi in retaliation, slicing his tormentor to pieces. Kyogai uses Rapid Drumming. With the painful memory fresh in his mind, the former Kizuki unleashes Rapid Drumming, playing his tsuzumis faster than ever before and sending the room rotating out of control. Tanjiro isn't even able to land down as the room's gravity rapidly shifts, dizzying him, and his situation becomes even more dire as the claw attack of Kyogai's tsuzumi now has five slashes. Suddenly, as the drumming slows down, Tanjiro lands down gently on the floor and notices something. The Demon Slayer realizes he was able to land without aggravating his wounds and thinks of a new tactic. Tanjiro defeats Kyogai. Utilizing shallow breaths to maintain power, Tanjiro is able to maintain his stance without getting hurt as the room shifts; he then senses a mould-like smell that appears when the claw attack is used. With his newfound knowledge, he is now able to avoid the slashes with little movement, shocking Kyogai. Preparing for a final stand, Tanjiro breathes in and uses Total Concentration: Water Breathing, Ninth Form: Splashing Water Flow, Turbulent. He closes the distance as the room shifts, and Kyogai is unable to retaliate. Finally, acknowledging his Blood Demon Art as incredible, Tanjiro senses the Opening Thread and successfully beheads the Drum Demon. In a moment of relief, Tanjiro accidentally takes a deep breath, injuring him. Kyogai, through his severed head, then asks if he meant his words regarding his Blood Demon Art. Tanjiro restates that it was amazing but adds that he cannot be forgiven for killing others, which the demon understands. Then, remembering he needs to take a blood sample to Tamayo, he uses a syringe-like knife provided by Yushiro and jabs it into Kyogai's fading body, watching as the blood is collected. Tamayo's cat appears before Tanjiro at that moment, surprising him. He gives the cat the sample and watches as the cat walks away and suddenly disappears, before remembering that he needs to locate Kiyoshi and Teruko. Kyogai cries as his skill has been recognized. In his final moments, Kyogai reminisces on when his song-writing was insulted in his past, and now realizes it is untrue thanks to Tanjiro's acknowledgement. As the Demon Slayer prays for his soul to rest in peace and departs, the former Kizuki sheds tears as his Blood Demon Art and tsuzumi playing have been recognized before fading into ashes. Tanjiro locates the children in a new room, though he sustains a book to the forehead when Teruko throws various objects at him in surprise. As the three make their way outside the mansion, Tanjiro suddenly senses the scent of blood. He quickly runs outside and sees the masked Demon Slayer kicking Zenitsu repeatedly, who is protecting Nezuko's box. Shocked by his act of kindness despite barely knowing him, Zenitsu gives his reason why. After falling outside of the mansion to the ground, Zenitsu and Shoichi remain relatively unscathed, aside from a gash on Zenitsu's head when he landed on it. Suddenly, they hear a voice yelling, ""Comin' through!"" from inside the mansion. Bursting through the door is the masked Demon Slayer. Zenitsu quickly recognizes him as the fifth survivor of Final Selection, the first to enter and leave the mountain before everyone. Zenitsu protects Nezuko's box. Having sensed a demonic feeling outside, the masked Slayer sees Tanjiro's box and sprints towards it, only for Zenitsu to block his way. Angered, he reminds Zenitsu they are both Demon Slayers and need to kill what is inside the box, demanding he move once again. When he refuses again, claiming it belongs to Tanjiro, the masked Slayer then decides he will kill both what's inside the box and him; he threatens Zenitsu with his blade, but he remains steadfast. Finally, the unknown Demon Slayer tells him a demon inside, but Zenitsu reveals he already knows. Zenitsu quickly realized that a demon was inside the box on Tanjiro's back when they first met, as it made inhuman noises. But he then perceived Tanjiro as so kind and gentle that it made him want to cry. As all organisms emit a sound, and through his excellent sense of hearing, Zenitsu is able to perceive people's thoughts through the sounds of their bodies. Time and time again, he was deceived by others, but since he saw Tanjiro had such innate kindness, he must have a good reason to carry a demon as a Demon Slayer. The masked Demon Slayer threatens Zenitsu. Despite his explanation, the masked Slayer refuses to back down and kicks him in the face. Zenitsu tackles him away and shields the box with his body, claiming that what is inside is precious to Tanjiro. Enraged, the masked Slayer repeatedly kicks him for intervening with his attack and the situation is seen by Tanjiro. Zenitsu reminds Tanjiro that he said what's inside is more important to him than his own life. The masked Slayer continues to kick him repeatedly, insulting him for not drawing his blade to attack as a Demon Slayer. Tanjiro sees Zenitsu holding the box and remembers the pain of finding Nezuko's bloody body in the snow. As the masked Demon Slayer decides to stab both Zenitsu and the box, an enraged Tanjiro yells at him to stop and charges toward him to protect Zenitsu.

14,The House with the Wisteria Family Crest,"He steps out of the mansion to find Zenitsu, who’d escaped before him. But then, he encounters an unforeseen circumstance before him: the battered Zenitsu, holding the box containing Nezuko in his arms, while the man wearing a boar hide stands in the way with two Nichirin swords drawn…[1]","""It's just like battling a four-legged beast!"". Defending Zenitsu for protecting Nezuko's box, Tanjiro charges at the masked Demon Slayer of Final Selection. With all his might, he lands a punch that cracks the stranger's ribs and sends him flying; he angrily states that Zenitsu isn't drawing his blade because it is taboo for Demon Slayers to harm one another, yet he endured a single-sided beating over his ignorance. The masked Slayer gives a weak apology and decides to fight Tanjiro bare-handed; Tanjiro tries to add that it is taboo for them to fight in any way but the masked Demon Slayer charges ahead and attacks. Tanjiro fights back but struggles to land a blow, with the stranger's low fighting stance akin to a beast; he tries to get down lower to land a hit but the masked Demon Slayer's extraordinary flexibility comes into play, hitting his head by bending his legs forward. Tanjiro head butts the masked Demon Slayer. He then demonstrates how far he can stretch backwards, causing Tanjiro to warn him against doing so due to his wounds. The stranger bluntly says he doesn't care about the future and simply enjoys the now, angering Tanjiro over his lack of foresight. He grabs the masked Demon Slayer by the shoulders and demands he calm himself down, head butting him square in the forehead. Inosuke Hashibira. Zenitsu hears the sound of the impact and worriedly believes their skulls have fractured. The stranger staggers back in pain and the boar mask falls off. To Tanjiro and Zenitsu's surprise, the Demon Slayer has a pretty and feminine face, in stark contrast to his muscular physique. He asks if they have a problem with his appearance, wondering why Zenitsu is staring at him, which Zenitsu denies. Tanjiro interjects that he has a ""petite, fair-skinned, and attractive"" face, to the stranger's chagrin. He introduces to Tanjiro himself as Inosuke Hashibira and tells him not to forget it; when Tanjiro asks how it is spelled, Inosuke freezes as he does not know, only to suddenly lose unconsciousness and fall over. Tanjiro believes he has a concussion from his headbutt; an amazed Teruko asks if she can touch his forehead, while Zenitsu is in disbelief that there is no blood on Tanjiro. Sometime later, Inosuke wakes up with a loud scream, frightening Zenitsu. He chases him until he sees the children and Tanjiro burying the dead from the mansion. He asks what they are doing and why, refusing to help out, to Zenitsu's bewilderment. Tanjiro answers that he isn't doing so because he is hurt, to Inosuke's shock. He suddenly yells out that he isn't to be underestimated and can bury hundreds of corpses and beat them all. That afternoon, the children, Tanjiro and Zenitsu pray for the souls of the deceased, while Inosuke remains busy with head butting the trees around him. Tanjiro's Kasugai Crow appears and instructs them to follow him. Tanjiro and Zenitsu begin to leave but are interrupted by Inosuke asking what they are doing; the former responds that they are descending the mountain and asks that he come with them. As they leave, Zenitsu, who still believes that Shoichi had defeated the Tongue Demon, holds onto him for protection, forcing Tanjiro to knock him unconscious in annoyance. Then, the crow instructs Kiyoshi to hold out his hands and spits out a small bag, being told by the crow and Tanjiro that the bag contains wisteria to ward off demons, given his status as a marechi. The children bid the Demon Slayers farewell and they go off on their way. Inosuke argues with Tanjiro. As they travel, Inosuke challenges ""loser"" and believes he can find a way to defeat him; Tanjiro irritably says his name is ""Kamado Tanjiro"", only for Inosuke to mince it into ""Kamaboko Gonpachiro"". The two begin to argue but are scolded by Zenitsu rhetorically asking if they can be any louder. As night falls, the trio arrive at a house with a wisteria family crest on the gate. The crow tells them they are to rest inside to recover from their injuries but the trio remains unsure. An elderly woman then opens the gates and sees them, recognizing the three as Demon Slayers and inviting them inside. The Wisteria House's hospitality. In the house, she provides them with a change of clothes and a meal; Zenitsu naively believes she is a monster but is scolded by Tanjiro for his rudeness. As they eat, Inosuke begins to gobble his food by hand and creating a large mess while doing so; Zenitsu asks for him to use chopsticks but Inosuke ignores him and continues to wolf down his meal. Later, the woman proves them with futons to sleep on; Inosuke quickly picks one and states ""first come, first served"". Tanjiro happily accepts his choice, to Inosuke's annoyance, and asks where Zenitsu will sleep, only for Inosuke to hurl a pillow at Zenitsu's head. Inosukes goads Tanjiro into fighting him over futons. The old woman then introduces them to a doctor to help check their injuries, where they realize that all of them have broken ribs. As they lie in bed, Inosuke then claims that the lump on his head from Tanjiro's head butt hurts more, leading Tanjiro to apologize. Zenitsu takes the chance and asks for Inosuke's apology for beating him, to which Inosuke claims he'll pass the chance, annoying him and Tanjiro for his rudeness. Tanjiro is informed by his Kasugai Crow that the house they are in belongs to a family who was rescued by Demon Slayers in the past; as such, they tend to Demon Slayers for free as thanks for their rescue. He then asks Inosuke about his reason for entering Final Selection. He gives his reason: a Demon Slayer entered his mountain, leading Inosuke to beat him and take his sword. He then learned about the selection process and the existence of demons. Tanjiro states that both of them were raised in the mountains but Inosuke denies this, claiming he doesn't have parents or siblings; instead living in the mountain to test his strength against others. Zenitsu takes the opportunity to ask Tanjiro about his reason for carrying a demon with him. Tanjiro first thanks him for protecting the box, embarrassing Zenitsu with his praise. He states that with his sense of smell, he immediately could tell he was kind and strong, though Zenitsu still remains unsure with himself over that aspect of him. Suddenly, Nezuko's box begins to shake, scaring the Demon Slayer greatly. Zenitsu seeing Nezuko for the first time. Tanjiro attempts to calm his friend but fails when Zenitsu grows even more anxious. The box's door open and Zenitsu hysterically attempt to escape the room, leading Inosuke to kick him away. He lands in front of the box as it begins to open; when a hand appears, Zenitsu runs away to a closet, only to see Nezuko crawl out. Zenitsu angry at Tanjiro for harbouring a girl. As Tanjiro calls to her, she stands up and shows her full self to Zenitsu. He subsequently becomes enraged that Tanjiro had been travelling ""with a girl this cute"". Tanjiro tries to reason with him but Zenitsu admonishes him over getting himself injured on multiple occasions just so Tanjiro could have a girl. He claims the Demon Slayer Corps isn't ""something you'd join for fun"" and angrily draws his blade to punish him.

15,Mount Natagumo,Their next destination is to the north-northeast.,"Tanjiro and Nezuko head to Mount Natagumo along with Zenitsu and Inosuke. The mountain is full of spiderwebs and is swarming with spiders... Leaving behind a frightened Zenitsu, Tanjiro and Inosuke make their way up the mountain, where they encounter a fellow Corps member entangled in spiderwebs.[1] Zenitsu finds Nezuko beautiful. After discovering the demon in Tanjiro's box is in fact his younger sister, Zenitsu becomes furious and admonishes him, claiming the Demon Slayer Corps isn't to be joined for fun. He becomes smitten by Nezuko's beauty and chases her around, only for Tanjiro to stop him. Instead, Zenitsu plays nice with him to get close to her and chases him too, while Inosuke sits outside listening to them. The woman caring for them, Hisa, appears next to him and gives him new, clean clothes to wear. She also offers to make them tempura for dinner. Inosuke barges into the room and headbutts Tanjiro in the back. Upon being asked on why, he only laughs in delight and chases him together with Zenitsu. After a doctor's visit confirms they are all fully healed, Tanjiro's Kasugai Crow appears shortly afterwards. The three are informed they must head north-northeast to Mount Natagumo. As they leave, Tanjiro thanks Hisa for taking them in. Hisa sees them off by striking a kiribi flint to cause sparks. Inosuke becomes annoyed and questions her actions aloud; Tanjiro grabs him in response and Zenitsu tells him she is striking sparks to bid them good luck for their mission. Finally, she tells them to live their lives with great pride and wishes them luck in battle. As they travel, Inosuke wonders what she means by ""good luck"" and ""luck in battle"", shocking Zenitsu with his cluelessness. Tanjiro answers by saying it means one knows their place and behaving in a way to never be ashamed of themselves. Inosuke remains confused and becomes more so when Tanjiro adds that she prayed for their safety, causing him to then ask what is the meaning of ""place"", ""never ashamed"", ""behave properly"" and asking out loud why she would pray for them. Tanjiro is annoyed by his tact rudeness and speeds up to ignore him; Inosuke sees this as a challenge and runs after, while Zenitsu lags behind. The trio reach Mount Natagumo. As night falls, the three reach Mount Natagumo. Zenitsu becomes frightened and sits on the road while Tanjiro and Inosuke question him. Zenitsu adamantly refuses to enter the mountain and asks if they don't feel creepy vibes from it, as the trio stare at the dark forest-riddled mountainside. They ignore his words and Zenitsu claims they are being abnormal for not being scared. Tanjiro suddenly detects a scent and runs off; Inosuke follows and Zenitsu eventually gets up to join them. They find an injured Demon Slayer begging for help but witness him suddenly pulled back into the forest, yelling out ""They were attached to me, too!"" as he is abducted. Seeing this, Zenitsu becomes more frightened but Tanjiro senses the demon scent again, now motivated to enter the forest. Inosuke then cuts him off by claiming that he will lead and Tanjiro can follow. Zenitsu becomes unwilling to continue. They run into the forest while Zenitsu remains at the forest's border, unwilling to continue. Mount Natagumo's forests are riddled with white spiders, ensnared Demon Slayers and white, spider-like demons. Inosuke and Tanjiro find the forest covered in numerous webs, annoying the former. Unexpectedly, Tanjiro then thanks him; confused, Inosuke is told he is thankful for him joining him in the forest, as the demon scent of earlier had unsettled him. Inosuke suddenly remembers the kind words Hisa said to them and seemingly understands their meaning now. Tanjiro spots something moving in the distance and signals his partner to follow him. Tanjiro finds a lone Demon Slayer. They find a anxious-looking Demon Slayer and Tanjiro claims they were sent as back up, then introduces himself and his Mizunoto rank. The Demon Slayer doesn't find comfort in this and claims they should have sent a Hashira instead, stating that adding Mizunotos is pointless. Inosuke suddenly punches him in the face and claims that his existence is pointless instead, criticizing him for his fear. The Demon Slayer informs them that a Kasugai Crow had given orders to head to the mountain and ten of them entered the forest. Not soon after entering, one of them suddenly drew his sword and slashed another in the throat. To his horror, he watches around him as the Demon Slayers suddenly begin killing each other, barely escaping the massacre. Shinobu and Giyu Tomioka. Elsewhere, an exhausted Kasugai Crow has reached a man in a shrine and informs him of the massacre. He wonders if they will find the Twelve Kizuki on the mountain and decides to send some Hashira. Behind him are Giyu Tomioka and Shinobu. As they acknowledge his decision, Shinobu asks Giyu about whether demons and humans could get along; Giyu only retorts that it is impossible as long as demons eat humans. Sitting on the road by himself, Zenitsu wonders if Tanjiro and Inosuke actually hate him, believing friends wouldn't leave him behind and would have talked to him into joining them on the mission. Instead, they left him behind to enter the mountain. His sparrow appears next to him and tries to encourage him by chirping that sulking isn't going to help and that his friends need him. Zenitsu dissuades his words, only for the sparrow to begin biting his hand. Annoyed at the sudden change of mood, he criticizes the bird for not being cute, pointing to Nezuko as an example. Suddenly, he remembers that Tanjiro had taken her along and is now in the mountain, motivating him to enter the forest with fury. A strange rattling travels through the air, unsettling Tanjiro. The Demon Slayer informs him that it was after this sound that the massacre began. As the sound continues, they see emerging from the fog are the dead Demon Slayers, walking towards them. They attack the three but they manage to dodge their blows, with Inosuke scoffing at their inability to understand the taboo of harming them. Tanjiro notices their strange movements and claims they're being manipulated by something. Inosuke decides to slash them all anyway, but Tanjiro claims they're still alive and they can't harm the corpses of their teammates regardless. Angered, Inosuke yells at Tanjiro for denying him each time and headbutts him in annoyance. With the surviving Demon Slayer close to getting harmed, the two work together and pull the attacker off him. Tanjiro senses a strange sweet scent of their back and slashes near it. His blade manages to slice several threads, dropping the Demon Slayer to the ground. He realizes that the others are ensnared too; thinking quickly, Inosuke rapidly slices above the other Demon Slayers' heads, cutting the threads and releasing them from control. As he looks around for the source, the demonic scent appears again momentarily. A demon controlling the webs. He then looks down his arm and sees two white spiders. Something from a distance manipulates the threads, pulling Tanjiro's arm, though he cuts them to free himself. He sees the spiders scurry away and realizes they're the ones attaching threads; as he looks up, he see the freed Demon Slayers under control again. A white female demon is responsible, wishing to control them till their arms and legs fall off and calling them her dolls. Tanjiro declares that cutting the threads will be pointless if they'll be reattached anyway. As he thinks of a plan, the scent appears again, carried by the wind. He sees the spiders and leaps away from their range, while Inosuke begins stabbing them with his blade. Tanjiro doesn't see this being helpful since they are small and far too numerous to kill at once, stating they must instead kill the demon controlling them. He asks Inosuke if he can pinpoint the demon's location but is stalled by the Demon Slayers continuing to attack him. With the demon scent continually appearing, his sense of smell isn't helpful now. Tanjiro and the Demon Slayer, Murata, continue to hold their attackers off but he suddenly sees something. A demon threatens Tanjiro and Inosuke. High in the trees, treading on the threads in a web, a pale child-like demon appears. It threatens them into staying away from their family's peaceful life. As Tanjiro wonders what it means by ""family"", the demon informs them that ""Mother"" will kill them quickly. Inosuke attempts to attack the demon but it is too high and far from his range, causing him to miss his swing and fall. Helping him get up, Tanjiro believes the demon is perhaps not the one responsible. Inosuke, having heard his instructions to find the demon, stabs both his blades into the ground, crouches down and spreads his arms. Inosuke uses Seventh Fang: Spatial Awareness. Using Beast Breathing, Seventh Form: Spatial Awareness, he scans the forest to search for the demon, detecting trees, vegetation and the landscape far around him. After looking hard and long enough, he finds a demon sitting atop a boulder in the distance to his left. Atop his webs, the pale demon declares that he won't let anyone get in their way: ""The five of us are going to live in bliss as a family"", as he draws a spiderweb in his hands.

16,Letting Someone Else Go First,"The further they go, the thicker the threads become. And those that are being controlled move in ways impossible for a human being.","Trying to stop their moves without hurting them proves to be even more difficult than before, but then Tanjiro makes a certain move…[1] After scanning the landscape of the forest with his Beast Breathing, Seventh Form: Spatial Awareness, Inosuke locates a demon in the distance. After informing Tanjiro, he is commended for his skills but they continue to get attacked by the controlled Demon Slayers. Elsewhere, Zenitsu has entered the forest in search of Nezuko, exhausted from running hard into the woods. Murata holds off the controlled Demon Slayers. Inosuke prepares to kill them all, but Tanjiro denies his plan and tries to find another way to stop them. When one attempts to slash at him, Murata blocks the blow, instructing them to leave him and carry on. Despite his lesser skill and cowardice earlier, Murata declares he is still a Demon Slayer and will find a way to fend them off, now armed with the knowledge of the threads and avoiding the spiders. Appreciative, Tanjiro grabs Inosuke and they run off to leave Murata, though Inosuke is annoyed at not being able to punch Murata first for insulting him. Another controlled Demon Slayer appears. As they travel further into Mount Natagumo, Tanjiro scolds Inosuke for his behaviour; Inosuke justifies himself by claiming Murata insulted him first, calling him ""Monjiro"", to his chagrin. Tanjiro asks if they are heading in the right direction; as he claims his senses are never wrong, Inosuke runs into several spider webs to his annoyance. They then encounter more controlled Demon Slayers, including a girl who has killed her entire troop. She begs them to not get closer and to summon a higher ranked member. As she continues controlling the Demon Slayers, the female demon finds joy in anyone getting closer to her, as her nearer threads and dolls are stronger. Suddenly, a voice calling her ""Mother"" resounds from behind, startling her. The short pale demon from earlier asks if she is able to kill them. Terrified, Mother initially doesn't answer the demon, Rui. Rui claims she is taking time and asks she hasten her efforts or he would tell ""Father"". Frightened at what might happen, Mother claims she can win and that she will protect him, begging Rui not to tell Father. Rui only tells her to hurry up, before leaving. Mother controlling her dolls. Now with the threat of punishment present, Mother forces her dolls to fight harder, unwilling to suffer the consequences. The controlled girl yells for Tanjiro to run but she suddenly swings her blade at incredible speed. She states she is being controlled and was never this strong normally; the threads on her body suddenly contort her arms back, breaking them at the joints. As she screams in pain, she continues to attack Tanjiro, who denounces the demon's actions as cruel. Mother then decides to use the rest of the dolls and several more Demon Slayers appear to face Tanjiro and Inosuke. One of them begs for death, as his arms and legs are broken and his bones are piercing his organs, leaving him in agony. As Tanjiro regards this scene in horror, Inosuke runs in and offers to kill him. Tanjiro, still wanting to help him, signals for him not to. Annoyed, Inosuke calls him out for repeatedly denying his attacks, stating he is blatantly wanting to die. He is forced back as the controlled Demon Slayers corner him with Tanjiro. Knowing the threads will only be attached again when cut, Tanjiro thinks of a new plan. He lures the controlled girl by running away, forcing her to chase him. He spins back around and grabs her in his arms. Using his Total Concentration Breathing, Tanjiro uses his enhanced strength to fling her into the high branches, entangling the threads and preventing them from controlling her. Mother becomes frustrated at her tangled dolls. Seeing this, Inosuke becomes excited and wants to copy his moves; he lures the other Demon Slayer into running after him and throws him into the branches. Unable to control the tangled threads, Mother deems the controlled Demon Slayers useless and decides to use a different doll. Now too scared to continue walking, Zenitsu feebly calls out to his friends and his sparrow Chuntaro. He apologizes for his burdens and suddenly hears Chuntaro atop his head. Chuntaro turns his head to ignore him but Zenitsu excitedly grabs his friend and thanks him for coming back; he calls the little bird cute but only second to Nezuko and sets out to find her again. Mother kills her human dolls. With just one Demon Slayer left to restrain, Inosuke and Tanjiro close in on him to tangle his threads in the trees; Inosuke had been making their objective a game to beat Tanjiro, seeing who can disable more dolls. Mother curses her humans dolls as useless and manipulates the threads attached to their heads, snapping their necks to Tanjiro’s horror. Inosuke curses the fact they all died despite their efforts but Tanjiro only approaches the closest Demon Slayer’s body. As he kneels down, he releases his rage and anger without saying anything, startling Inosuke into silence. Tanjiro gets up and states they must go on, to which Inosuke quietly agrees. Tanjiro saved Inosuke from Mother's demon doll. They continue travelling through the forest; Inosuke leads them in the right direction and Tanjiro finds that his sense of smell is returning. He detects two demon scents and senses something in the distance. Having detected it already, Inosuke charges forward to decapitate the threat. But as he leaps into the air and lands to attack, he finds it does not have a head and narrowly misses getting cut. They see it is a giant headless demon doll, controlled by the threads and weaponized with blades as its arms. Zenitsu makes his way slowly in the forest, calling out to Nezuko and Tanjiro. He becomes frightened hearing something in the distance but sees it is simply a flock of birds. Now becoming frustrated, he promises to find Nezuko and leave the forest; he continues calling her name out loud and doesn’t notice he is being followed. Tanjiro and Inosuke dodge getting hit by the doll, while the latter notes it doesn’t have the usual weak spot, a head. As he wonders how they will attack, Tanjiro states they will slice its body diagonally from its head to its waist with a monk’s hood cut. Inosuke impatiently attacks and lunges forward without waiting for Tanjiro. The doll hits him, cutting Inosuke with minor slashes to his body. Deeming the doll fast but still manageable to attack, he fails to notice the spiders on him and is restrained in numerous threads. Inosuke is nearly cut in half but is saved when Tanjiro parries the blow to the side. Cut free from the threads, Inosuke becomes giddy at the sight of someone getting the better of him. Tanjiro tells him they must work and think together. As the doll prepares to attack them again, Tanjiro crouches down and signals for Inosuke to launch himself off of Nezuko’s box. He climbs atop the box and slashes both of the doll’s arms. Tanjiro then signals for him to get higher; Inosuke leaps upwards while Tanjiro uses Water Breathing, Fourth Form: Striking Tide, slicing the doll’s legs off. He gives the signal for the monk’s hood cut while Inosuke notes that the whole plan is flowing like water, as naturally as Tanjiro is intending. Tanjiro and Inosuke defeat Mother's doll As he descends, he realizes Tanjiro doesn’t look at the first attack but the entire battle, commending him. Inosuke lands down and uses both his blades to slice the doll’s body in half, killing it, to Mother’s shock. Tanjiro congratulates him for the finishing blow but Inosuke stays still, ignoring his praises. Instead, he sprints towards him and declares that he can do anything Tanjiro can do; grabbing him, he hurls Tanjiro high into the air. As he is launched, he detects the scent of a demon, realizing it is what Inosuke had detected. As Mother becomes scared that even her most powerful doll was killed, she shifts the blame to Rui’s earlier threats and why she panicked. She then looks up and sees Tanjiro descending towards her; he breathes in and positions his blade to use First Form, Water Surface Slash to kill her. She becomes terrified at her impending death but suddenly calms herself, realizing that with death, she can be released and know peace. Tanjiro uses Blessed Rain after the Drought. Seeing that she has fully surrendered, Tanjiro changes his form and uses Fifth Form: Blessed Rain after the Drought, bringing her a peaceful death. Mother notices she feels as if she is showered by a gentle rain, not in any pain at all but instead feeling warm. Never imagining her death could be so peaceful, she states she can be released. Mother remembers a moment in the past, when she was harshly wounded by an immense, spider-like demon, Father. She apologizes to him and asks why he is mad. Rui only taunts her for not knowing what had displeased him. Another demon appears from behind, laughing that “Mom’s in trouble with Dad again”. Mother is then grabbed by the hair by Father and hoisted up, causing her immense pain, as another pale female demon watches the scene. Mother warns Tanjiro of a Twelve Kizuki demon on the mountain Mother looks at Tanjiro’s eyes and comments on their kind appearance; she remembers that while she was human, someone had looked at her with the same expression. But as she tries to remember her past, she fails to recall the details, instead stating it must have been someone who treasured her. She then wonders what that person is doing now, with tears in her eyes. In her final moments, Mother thanks Tanjiro by informing him that a member of the Twelve Kizuki is on the mountain, wishing him to be careful as she fades completely. Tanjiro, hearing her last words, becomes stunned that a genuine member is on the mountain.

17,You Must Master a Single Thing,"The Twelve Kizuki, directly subordinate to Muzan Kibutsuji, are here…When Tanjiro slays the mother of the Spider Demons of Mount Natagumo, he learns that a demon who might become the key to turning Nezuko back into a human could be in this very forest. Despite how battered Inosuke is, he heads deeper into the forest with Tanjiro. Meanwhile, Zenitsu trudges forlornly through the woods, only to encounter a human-headed spider.[1]","With a true member of the Twelve Kizuki present on Mount Natagumo, Tanjiro realizes it must possess a higher concentration of Muzan's blood, reaffirming his goal to extract it for the medicine for Nezuko. He runs back to Inosuke, who asks if he had defeated Mother. Tanjiro tentatively answers so and asks if he is alright, noticing his numerous cuts. Inosuke ignores his ""showering of sensitivity and kindness"", proudly proclaiming he can beat him at anything. Despite this, Tanjiro blames himself for Inosuke's injuries and then remembers Mother's final moments; how she gave off the scent of suffering and terror and when she willingly surrendered. Tanjiro attempts to patch Inosuke's wounds, to his annoyance, and ponders on the strange nature of the mountain, as it has both a Twelve Kizuki member and a demon family within, despite the fact that demons don't group together. Elsewhere, Zenitsu feels a prick on the hand as he continues his way around the forest. Now angry at being lost for so long, he wonders about Tanjiro and Inosuke's whereabouts; he finds a two way fork at the road and becomes more frustrated, as well as annoyed at the terrible smell present and numerous spiders around. With his enhanced hearing, he senses someone behind him and yells at them to stay still; instead, he looks down to see a large spider with a human head. An immense spider demon emerges from the house. Terrified, he runs way screaming he must be in a dream, unwilling to believe what he has just seen. He begs to wake up on Nezuko's lap and plow fields just to escape his ""nightmare"". As he stops, he finds himself in an enormous clearing in the forest and sees numerous captured humans transforming into spiders. Zenitsu sees a floating house suspended by threads and is further repulsed by the stronger stench of the area, believing it is pungent enough to kill Tanjiro with his sense of smell. He hears a rustling from the house and sees an enormous spider demon emerging from below. Zenitsu runs away at the sight of the monster but the demon taunts him by saying that, ""You're already losing"". He tries to ignore his words but the demon continues talking about his situation becoming dire. Zenitsu asks what the demon is talking about; the spider asks that he look at his hand and he sees it has become contused and blistered. The spider tells him he was poisoned by a bite earlier and will soon transform into one as well. The demon tells Zenitsu he will soon be his slave inside of 30 minutes, commenting he will feel pain, dizziness, nausea, lose consciousness and then become a spider, laughing as he taunts the Demon Slayer over his impending fate. ""Son"" of the Spider Family taunts Zenitsu. Now even more frightened, Zenitsu runs away and is chased by numerous transformed spiders. The demon reminds him that running is futile, to which Zenitsu yells he already knows, climbing up a tree to avoid the spiders. The spider demon tells him not to worry, as his intelligence will be reduced too. Zenitsu refuses to listen and laments he has no friends, a girlfriend or anyone that likes him; hearing this, the spider instead offers an extra dose of poison to accelerate his transformation. Zenitsu becomes frightened at his fate and hugs the tree, reminding him  of when he had climbed up a tree to escape his trainer, admonishing him for running away continuously. ""Come down here, you little moron!"" His trainer commands him to climb down to resume training but Zenitsu adamantly refuses, sure that he will die by continuing. His trainer tells him he won't at the level they will be at and tells him again to get down. Zenitsu refuses, calling him as ""Gramps"", his trainer commands to be addressed as ""Master""; Zenitsu then replies it is because he loves him, much to his trainer's surprise. Zenitsu recalls when he first met him; he was with a girl who made him raise money just to start an affair with a different person. Racked with debt, he was rescued by his trainer and subsequently taught to be a Demon Slayer. Though he aspired to meet his expectations, he didn't believe himself to be capable of reaching them. He states that he does regret being so weak-willed and cowardly, adding that he had also been training in secret without getting sleep, yet he still is yet to show any amount of progress. As he laments his inability to do anything, thunderclouds roll in. Zenitsu is struck by lightning. His trainer attempts to calm him down but as he continues ranting, a lightning bolt strikes the tree, hitting Zenitsu. Recalling the moment as he fell down, his hair turned yellow by the lightning, he reflects on the tragedy that is his life. He was thankful just to be alive, he hated himself more than anything, and he always thought he could hold it in but would always fall apart emotionally nonetheless. Still reflecting on what brought him to this moment, Zenitsu knows he would always do everything he can, angrily asking why he has to turn into a spider now. Watching the Demon Slayer yelling and crying in the branches, the Spider Demon grows more confused at his opponent. As the spiders climb up the tree, Zenitsu tells them to stall and let him speak; as he grabs his head in frustration, clumps of hair come off, to his shock and annoyance, as he wasn’t told his hair would be gone first. The Spider Demon laughs at his impending doom, causing Zenitsu to pass out in fear and lose consciousness. Stunned to see the Demon Slayer asleep, the demon mocks his cowardice, expressing disbelief he was sent to kill his family. As his body slumps from the tree and plummets, Zenitsu begins to breathe. Before he can hit the ground, he twists himself upright and plants his feet against the tree, preparing to attack. He launches himself at the Spider Demon, who retaliates using Poison Sputum, hurling a blob of acidic poison at him. Zenitsu dodges in time and lands safely, as the demon notes that he appears and acts completely differently now. As Zenitsu prepares to attack with his Thunder Breathing, First Form, the demon signals his spiders to attack him. They converge on him and force the Demon Slayer to repeat his stance. The demon then spits another poison blob, forcing him back again. He notices Zenitsu is repeating the same stance and realizes to his delight that he can only do one form. Zenitsu is encouraged to hone himself to perfection. In a previous training session, Zenitsu becomes despondent after only being able to do the first form, but his trainer sees this as cause for celebration, telling the young man he can hone it. Recalling this moment, he remembers that he was initially angry because Thunder Breathing has six forms. His trainer then began hitting his head repeatedly; as he does so, he explains that swords need to be struck continually to remove impurities, to give them better durability. Zenitsu instead asks why he continues to clobber him to improve, stating that he isn’t made of steel. As time continues to tick down, the Spider Demon taunts him for calling himself a Demon Slayer despite doing just one form. As his hand begins to shake, Zenitsu remembers his trainer’s encouragement, telling him it is okay to cry and run; instead, he asks that he never give up and to believe in himself. His trainer tells him he can be the most durable blade of all and to hone his form to perfection, as electricity crackles from Zenitsu’s hand. Launching another Poison Sputum blob, Zenitsu dodges it in time but sees himself surrounded by the spiders. As they converge on him again, he remembers another pivotal moment during his training; a fellow student had angrily dismissed him, frustrated by his crying and cowardice. A fellow student dismisses Zenitsu for his cowardice. He states their trainer was an extraordinary man and time spent with him is being wasted; when Zenitsu tries to talk about him, referring to him as “Gramps”, the student rebukes him for acting familiar with him, a respected former Hashira. Zenitsu reflects on his life; as an orphan, he had no one to give him hope for the future, no one to be proud of him for doing good. No one believed he could succeed, as his cowardice made people scornful of him, no one but Gramps. His trainer held on and continued to push and reprimand him. Any time he tried to escape, he was there to take him back, and although he was sometime harsh, Gramps never once abandoned him. Zenitsu uses Thunderclap and Flash, Sixfold. The Spider Demon signals his minions to poison him even more; with their barbed tongues, the spiders attempt to envenomate Zenitsu further. As he backs away to safety, he vomits blood from the poison, causing him to stop and allowing the spiders to overwhelm him. As the Spider Demon watches in delight, the spiders are all suddenly blown away as lightning envelops Zenitsu. As the demon lands down, watching the Demon Slayer in renewed fear, Zenitsu uses Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash, and extends the attack Sixfold. Zenitsu kills the Spider Demon. The Spider Demon uses Poison Sputum once more but the poisonous blob is too slow to hit Zenitsu. He speeds around the clearing in preparation to strike, as the demon loses track of the Demon Slayer. Seeing his chance, Zenitsu propels himself at the retreating demon, following it to its house and using one of the threads to launch himself upwards, decapitating the demon instantly. The creature becomes angered at his death at the hands of someone like him, expressing disbelief at the absurdity of Zenitsu’s attack while barely able to move his legs and arms before disintegrating to ash. Zenitsu lands atop the suspended house; as he lies in pain from the poison, he addresses his dream and how he has achieved it; he has now become powerful and can help those in need, as his trainer had taught him. Despite this, he believes his dream to be over with the poison. Chuntaro lands beside his master and tears up. He apologizes to the sparrow but Chuntaro flies away. Remembering his trainer’s words to, “Don’t ever give up!”, Zenitsu uses his breathing to slow the poison’s circulation, unwilling to let his trainer “let him have it” and not wanting Tanjiro to be mad. Elsewhere, Tanjiro hears the sound of a lightning strike in the distance; Zenitsu’s attack. Confused since he doesn’t smell a thunder cloud, he asked Inosuke, who brushes aside his concern. As he is about to cross a river, Tanjiro offers to investigate further and asks if he is descending the mountain. Inosuke asks why he would give up and Tanjiro points out his injuries. Inosuke irritably denies being hurt, to his friend’s bewilderment. At that moment, they spot a pale demon across the river, Tanjiro noting that he was unable to sense her because of the demon scent throughout the mountain. Father appears before Tanjiro and Inosuke. Inosuke gives chase and pursues her, only for her to suddenly call out, “Father!”. Wondering what she means, Inosuke is answered by the appearance of an enormous, spider-like demon, leaping into the water. As Inosuke and Tanjiro stagger back at the sight of the new threat, Father angrily demands they “Don’t come near my family, stay away!”. As the female demon, Daughter, leaves them to escape, Father prepares to strike a vulnerable Inosuke. Tanjiro responds with Water Breathing, Second Form: Water Wheel, his blade barely able to cut into his arm.

18,A Forged Bond,Tanjiro and Inosuke face off against the father of the Spider Demons of Mount Natagumo.,"Tanjiro unleashes an attack, only to get hurled away by the demon’s overwhelming power. Landing near a river, he comes upon a young demon Rui torturing his demon sister. Hearing Rui call their bonds of terror and hatred “family ties,” Tanjiro is enraged. So begins the battle between Rui and Tanjiro.[1] Upon reaching Mount Natagumo, Shinobu and Giyu come across the corpses of dozens of Demon Slayers. She asks if he was acquainted with any of them, seeing him so quiet, and believes there are no survivors. Shinobu adds that they were advised that several Mizunotos have joined the battle but believes them to be dead now. As they travel through the forest, Shinobu tries to comment on the full moon's appearance; Giyu ignores her, causing her to say that they should at least get along being on the mission together. He retorts he is only here to kill demons. Ribbing him for acting so callously, Shinobu nonetheless agrees; they decide to split up, with Shinobu branching away to begin investigating from the west, while Giyu continues forward. Tanjiro and Inosuke battle Father Father of the Spider Family emerges from the forest to kill the intruders of the mountain. He attempts to punch Inosuke but Tanjiro intervenes with Water Breathing, Second Form: Water Wheel, cutting into his forearm. However, the demon's arm is too hard, leaving Tanjiro stuck in place and unable to slice through. Father tries to punch him with his free arm but Inosuke slices into it to prevent him from attacking. Father flings them away simultaneously; Tanjiro lands on a nearby boulder and tries to think of a new solution. The demon runs towards him, yelling at the Demon Slayer to stay away from his family and destroying the boulder he was atop of. Inosuke leaps from behind and tries to stab Father, only for the demon to punch him away with incredible force. Hurt by the impact, Inosuke mutters that he isn't at full power and feels the bleeding of his wounds is worsening his state. He runs away and is chased by Father; Tanjiro sprints alongside the river and uses Water Breathing, Second Form: Improved, Lateral Water Wheel. He slices a nearby tree and it falls on top of Father, pinning him down. Initially confused, Inosuke sees it was Tanjiro who had done so, amazed at his skills. With the demon pinned to the riverbed, Tanjiro sees his chance to slice its neck with the final and most powerful form. He breathes in to strengthen himself, as Inosuke watches in anticipation of seeing something incredible. He runs towards Father and uses Water Breathing's Tenth Form, only for Father to block his blade using the fallen tree. With Tanjiro stuck to the trunk, the giant demon flings him far away; Inosuke calls out to ""Kentaro"" and Tanjiro begs him not to die till he returns. As he sees his friend hurtling away in the distance, Inosuke is left to battle Father alone. Shinobu finds Zenitsu. Atop the suspended house, Zenitsu's condition worsens as he continues his attempts to slow the poison. As he struggles to breathe, he becomes unable to feel his arms and legs, as they have withered away. Down below, the transformed Demon Slayers look at the house, worried for their saviour's safety. Zenitsu apologizes to Nezuko; as he slowly loses the battle against the poison, he remembers his trainer's words to ""Don't give up"", giving him the hope to continue. Suddenly, something enters his vision; Shinobu lands down beside him and asks if he is alright. Tanjiro finds Rui torturing Daughter over ""family matters"". After being hurled a great distance into the forest, Tanjiro uses Water Breathing, Second Form: Water Wheel to slow down his momentum, allowing him to hit the ground without severely injuring himself. Nonetheless, he slams into a tree. As he collects himself, he hears a cry of pain and walks towards it, the voice begging someone to “Please stop!”. He crouches nearby and watches the situation. Daughter appears on the ground, bleeding heavily and crying, her face slashed by the web in Rui's hands. Rui looks to his side and asks why Tanjiro is watching, stating that their debacle isn’t a show. Tanjiro asks if the two are allies; Rui claims their bond is closer than just allies: they are family. He states he and Daughter have a “powerful bond"" and their situation is just between them; he tells Tanjiro not to interfere, “or I’ll carve you up”. Tanjiro claims the demon is wrong; whether a bond is between allies or family, they are equally precious, retorting his statement that a bond between allies is flimsy. He claims that those with a strong bond have the scent of trust, yet all he can sense between him and his sister is terror, hatred and repulsion. He flatly calls their bond forged, surprising Daughter and enraging Rui. ""Come on, say it will you"". At that moment, another Demon Slayer appears. He sees Rui and determines the child-like demon to be an easy kill, seeing him as an easy way to climb the ranks and get better pay. He charges at Rui but the demon flings a web at his attacker, eviscerating his body instantly. As Tanjiro tries to comprehend the sudden and gruesome death before him, Rui turns to Tanjiro and menacingly asks what he had just said. Tanjiro feels the fearsome intimidation the demon is giving off and apologizes to Inosuke, begging him to stay alive and promising to assist him after his new battle. Rui demands he repeat his statement; undaunted, Tanjiro tells him he will say it over and over again, calling their bond forged. Elsewhere, behind a tree, Inosuke catches his breath and watches as Father looks around the forest for him. The giant demon sees a trail of his blood and Inosuke realizes he has been spotted. Inosuke attempts to slice Father's arm As Father approaches him, Inosuke tries to think of a plan, barely escaping when the spider demon destroys his cover. As he runs away, he tries to rationalize how he can stay alive till Tanjiro's return. He suddenly stops in his tracks, thinking about how he is retreating since that isn't who he is. He turns back and charges towards Father; leaping into the air, the Demon Slayer slams his right blade into the demon's forearm. Annoyed that his way of thinking is becoming like Tanjiro's, Inosuke hammers his second blade into his first and successfully slices off Father's forearm. Satisfied at causing real damage, Inosuke raises his swords at his opponent. Seeing this, Father runs away, to the surprise of the Demon Slayer; Inosuke demands he come back to face him and runs after the demon. Tanjiro attacks Rui but is forced back by the demon's numerous threads, several of which have managed to slice Tanjiro's face. Rui declares his intentions to torture him slowly, but offers an instant death if he takes back his words. Tanjiro vehemently refuses and bluntly states he is the only one not making sense, to Rui's silent fury. Daughter watches in shock as the Demon Slayer challenges him. Running through the forest, Inosuke attempts to find Father. He kneels down from the pain of his injuries but attempts to brush them aside and keep going. Using Spatial Awareness, albeit with some trouble from his injuries, he locates the demon hiding up a nearby tree. Believing the monster is planning to ""make me use my head again"", Inosuke then watches as Father begins to shake uncontrollably. Thinking the demon is shaking in fear at the sight of him, he is proven to be mistaken when the outer layer of the demon's skin sheds away, revealing a far more powerful form. Father lands down to meet his opponent; as Inosuke stares in shock at his opponent's new body, he becomes overwhelmed with fear and doubt. Inosuke breaks his swords attacking Father. Suddenly, he thinks back to Tanjiro's last words to him, ""Don't die until I get back!"", and Hisa's words of advice to ""Always live your lives with great pride"". Motivated to keep fighting, Inosuke declares he is ""Inosuke Hashibira of the Demon Slayer Corps"" and raises his swords to fight. Father suddenly punches him square in the body, sending him flying into several trees and slamming into the ground. The demon quickly finds him and tries to kill him; Inosuke leaps high into the air to dodge the blow and uses Beast Breathing, Third Fang: Devour as he descends. When he tries to slash at Father's neck, his blades snap upon making contact. In shock, he fails to dodge Father's next attack and is violently punched into a tree. A woman apologizes to Inosuke in his memories. Father grabs him by the head and yells at the Demon Slayer to stay away from his family. As he begins to crush Inosuke's head, Inosuke desperately uses Beast Breathing, First Fang: Pierce with his broken swords. The tips stab into Father's neck but the demon remains unfazed. Father holds him outstretched, separating Inosuke from his swords, and slowly crushes him. As his life flashes before him, Inosuke sees a woman apologizing to him and recalls his friends and Hisa; the woman wishes for him to survive as she stands on top of a cliff, calling out to him. Inosuke asks who she is but blood pours out of his mask. Giyu kills Father with Fourth Form: Striking Tide. Suddenly, something speeds into the battle and slices off Father's arm, freeing Inosuke. Giyu stands before him, who asks if he had slashed the demon, staring in wonder at the new arrival. Father regrows his arm and charges at the Demon Slayer; unafraid, Giyu uses Water Breathing, Fourth Form: Striking Tide and instantly slices the giant demon to pieces. In awe at what he had just witnessed, Inosuke comments he has never seen someone as powerful as him. As Tanjiro dodges the threads coming towards him, he senses the odour of the forest is clearing, allowing him to sense the threads once again. Rui notes that his opponent is smarter than he thought and isn't afraid but sees it as irrelevant. Tanjiro runs towards him and leaps into the air; Rui launches a thread at him and Tanjiro responds with Water Breathing, First Form: Water Surface Slash. As his sword makes contact, the thread slices through the steel and continues its way towards Tanjiro.

19,Hinokami,"Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira, slays the father of the Spider Demons with a single stroke of his sword. Inosuke, thrilled to see such a display of swordsmanship by someone in a completely different league from himself, challenges Giyu to a duel.","Meanwhile, the Insect Hashira, Shinobu Kocho, appears in front of Zenitsu, who lies near death as the poison circulates throughout his body…[1] As Tanjiro attempts to slash the incoming thread with his sword, it slices cleanly through the steel; he is barely able to dodge it and sustains a cut across his face. As he stares in shock seeing his weapon destroyed, Rui looks at his downed opponent. Elsewhere, Inosuke watches as Father’s dismembered body fades to ash, amazed by the strength and power of Giyu; he turns and sees an excited Inosuke, giving him a confused expression before leaving. Inosuke demands he stop walking away; he declares to his saviour that since he had beaten a Twelve Kizuki, he will defeat him and then become the most powerful Demon Slayer. Giyu only tells him to go back training, infuriating the masked Demon Slayer. Giyu ties up an unsuspecting Inosuke. Giyu states that Father is nothing close to a Twelve Kizuki, while unwinding a bundle of rope. Inosuke retorts his statement and claims he was right that Father wasn’t a Kizuki demon. He claims it was Tanjiro who said so but suddenly finds himself tied to a tree. Stunned by his sudden speed, he watches as Giyu walks away and leaves him hanging. He tells him to stay out of battle if he can’t realize his own injuries, causing Inosuke to yell at him to come back. Shinobu chats with Zenitsu At the suspended house, Zenitsu sees Shinobu asking if he is alright; he mutters “Gramps”, causing her to ask who is he calling to. Zenitsu says he appeared and told him not to give up. Shinobu tells him it was because he is seeing his life flash before him, stating it was probably a way for his body to avoid dying; by going through past memories. Shinobu states she doesn’t know for sure; she instead commends him for slowing the poison’s circulation with his breathing. She injects his now shrunken arm with an antidote. Zenitsu turns his head and sees numerous black-clad workers helping the transformed Demon Slayers. As Tanjiro continues his battle with Rui, he notes that his threads are even stronger than Father’s body, whom he was unable to cut through. Realizing his inexperience had led his sword to breaking, he apologizes to Sakonji and Haganezuka. Rui launches several threads at him but Tanjiro is able to dodge them. He thinks of a plan but the threads continue to prevent him from getting close. Rui asks if he still refuses to take back his words and Tanjiro shows his defiance. With his answer, the demon goes for the kill and launches his threads in the form of webs, ready to slice Tanjiro to pieces. Before they hit him, something makes contact with the webs; Nezuko appears in front of him and takes the hit, sustaining deep cuts. Tanjiro is shocked and pulls her to safety to inspect her wounds. Rui lashes out at Daughter. As Daughter notes that she has the aura of a demon, Rui begins to shudder at what he has witnessed; he asks if the girl is his sibling; Tanjiro answers that it doesn’t matter to him, as he sees Nezuko’s sliced hand about to fall off. Rui realizes that Tanjiro’s sister has transformed into a demon, yet protected him regardless; the younger sibling protecting the older sibling, the genuine bond that he has longed for. Daughter sees his sudden change in personality and tells him she is his elder sister, asking him not to desert her. Rui angrily dismisses her and launches several threads, slicing her body to pieces.  Rui claims that, “none of you ever managed to fulfill the roles you were given”, rejecting his family. She claims she became the sister he had wanted, asking for a chance at redemption. Rui decides to relent, giving her the task of killing the Demon Slayers on the mountain and promising to forgive her when she does. Daughter acknowledges his wishes and leaves. He then calls out to Tanjiro and claims he was moved seeing the bond between him and his sister. With nothing left but death for Tanjiro, Rui gives him an ultimatum; hand over Nezuko and he will spare his life. When Tanjiro states he doesn’t understand what he wants, Rui tells him she will be his new sister, starting now. He vehemently refuses, saying that she isn’t a thing and that she has her own feeling and will. The demon responds by claiming he can make a bond between them, one built on terror, since he is much stronger than him. Rui reveals he is Lower Five of the Twelve Kizuki Tanjiro raises his blade in anger and states that using fear to hold someone isn’t a familial bond. He retorts his lack of understanding will lead him to never getting what he wants. Rui becomes irritated by his loud rebuttal and claims they don’t see at the same level. Putting aside Nezuko’s box, Tanjiro walks out of the bushes and faces his opponent, flatly stating, “I’ll never hand Nezuko over to you!”. When Rui claims he can just kill him and take her then, the Demon Slayer states he will cut off his head first. Rui becomes excited at his spirit and states he can try, then reveals the engraved number on his eye, the mark of Lower Rank Five. Rui thinks about his demon family and their roles; the parents protect the children and the elder siblings protect the youngest sibling, even at the cost of their lives. To him, not understanding that role give you no reason to live. He states that Tanjiro’s role is to give him Nezuko, and he cannot defy it because he cannot kill him. Tanjiro realizes his opponent is a true Twelve Kizuki, thinking how could he defeat him with his broken blade if his neck is tougher than his threads. Rui sees the hopeful glimmer in his eyes, calling him foolish for believing he has a chance at killing him. Nezuko ensnared in Rui's threads. He pulls on several threads behind Tanjiro and takes Nezuko before his eyes. He grabs her and asks if he now recognizes his own role. Tanjiro demands he let her go, with Rui reminding him that he offered to spare him if he doesn’t fight back; Nezuko angrily claws at his face in defiance. As the Demon Slayer gets closer, Lower Five flings several threads him, forcing him back. He sees that Nezuko has vanished; when a splash of blood falls on his blade, he looks up and sees her strung up in the trees, with horrific cuts throughout her body. Rui tells him not to be shocked, as Nezuko is a demon and she can heal; he then decides to string her up to “teach her a lesson” and let her bleed. As Tanjiro seethes with rage, Rui taunts him by adding his idea to let her burn in the sunlight. Tanjiro attacks the demon but is stopped by several threads slowing his approach. Rui kicks him in the face, launching him high into the air and causing him to vomit blood. Rui smacks him with his hand and Tanjiro staggers in pain, bleeding heavily. The Lower Rank taunts him for thinking he could kill him and openly accepts an attempt to decapitate him. In desperation, Tanjiro attempts to slice his neck but finds his blade unable to cut through Rui’s skin. Rui reminds him again that he has no chance to win and violently kicks him across the forest floor, stating his body is more durable than his threads; Nezuko, watching the confrontation, struggles and squirms in her restraints to help him, as Tanjiro realizes this is the true power of a Twelve Kizuki. Annoyed by her screaming, Rui tightens the threads holding her and they cut deeper into her body, making her scream. Nezuko loses consciousness, to Rui’s confusion, as he notes that something about her is different to other demons. Tanjiro uses Tenth Form: Constant Flux. Despite being enraged, Tanjiro calms himself down and decides to use the final and most precise form at his disposal. Lunging at the demon with renewed speed, he successfully parries the threads by gathering momentum in each swing. He uses Water Breathing, Tenth Form: Constant Flux and is able to slice through the threads, giving him the motivation to defeat the demon. Undaunted, Rui reveals his threads aren't at maximum strength and infuses new ones with his blood. Using Blood Demon Art: Cutting Thread Cage, he surrounds Tanjiro in a web of blood threads to shred him, bidding him goodbye as they close in. Surrounded and unable to cut through the new threads, Tanjiro realizes he will die and suddenly sees his life flash before him. Tanjuro performs the ceremonial Kagura. In a web of pivotal memories, one moment stands out. During a moment during his childhood, playing and dancing with Nezuko, he sees his father, who tells him to, “Breathe. Get your breathing under control and become Hinokami”. He then remembers being with his mother outside on a cold wintery day, watching his father’s ceremonial kagura. She explains that in a family that works with fire, he performs this ritual to ""Hinokami” to ward off disasters. Tanjiro then asks how he can dance for so long in the snow despite being so frail. In another time, his father Tanjuro answers that he uses a special breathing technique; one that can allow you to move without ever exhausting yourself. If he can master it, he can dance forever and even ignore the cold. Tanjuro then asks for his son to, if nothing else, pass the kagura and his earrings down to his descendants, as he had promised before. Tanjiro uses Hinokami Kagura: Dance. After gathering the knowledge from his memories, Tanjiro begins to breathe in a different pattern; his Water Breathing ignites into fire as he uses his new Hinokami Kagura, using the form Dance to slice through the blood threads. Seeing his strongest threads cut, Rui deploys even more and strews them in front of the Demon Slayer’s path. Though he sustains several cuts, Tanjiro continues to press onwards, aware that stopping now after switching between Water Breathing and Hinokami Kagura will render him immobile. Tanjiro overwhelms Rui. Pushing himself to rescue Nezuko, Tanjiro attacks Lower Rank Five with renewed ferocity, slicing the blood threads in his way as he closes in on Rui. Shocked, Rui backs away and is forced to defend himself, weaving around the forest to escape. He tries to use more blood threads but Tanjiro is now able to chase him down and cut through them all. He detects the Opening Thread and sees his chance to slice off his neck, ignoring the threads now close to cutting into him. As Nezuko hangs in the threads, she is visited by a vision of her mother. Kie begs her to wake up and save Tanjiro. She says she can do it and do her best. She tearfully asks for her to awaken, “Or your brother will be killed too!”. At that moment, Nezuko regains consciousness and stretching out her hand, causing drops of her blood on the threads to glow. Using her own Blood Demon Art, Exploding Blood, she ignites the droplets and the threads burn away. Tanjiro decapitates Lower Five. The flames race down the webs, reaching Rui and Tanjiro; the fires burn away the threads in Tanjiro’s path and allows his blade to make contact with Rui’s neck. In disbelief, the demon can only watch as the Demon Slayer proclaims, “The bond between Nezuko and me can’t be severed by anyone!”.

20,Pretend Family,"As his life flashes before his eyes, he remembers his father's kagura dance and unleashes a whole new technique, completely different from Water Breathing. Hinokami Kagura: Dance... Knowing that this move could mean killing each other, he uses his new move to slice off Rui's head.","As Tanjiro crawls towards Nezuko, who lies on the ground, riddled with wounds, someone appears before him…[1] In a combined effort using Hinokami Kagura and Exploding Blood, Tanjiro and Nezuko defeat Lower Rank Five, Rui. As the demon’s body falls, Tanjiro collapses in exhaustion, while Nezuko’s body lands on the ground, having burned away her restraints. He knows he had succeeded thanks to his father’s kagura, yet he remains unsure how its memory had helped him beat Rui. His vision blurs from pushing himself to the brink and his body is in physical agony. He slowly crawls to his sister and remembers that Inosuke still needs help. Rui reveals he beheaded himself to escape dying. Suddenly, he detects the scent of blood from behind him, noting that he doesn’t smell ash: the scent present during a demon’s death. To his horror, he hears something walking toward him, despite believing he had decapitated Rui. The demon taunts him for believing he had won, revealing he cut off his head using his threads to avoid dying. Now deciding to kill both of the siblings, he exclaims he hasn't been this enraged in a long time. Rui uses Blood Demon Art: Murderous Eye Basket As he attempts to crawl away faster, Tanjiro tries to get his breathing under control. Rui mentions that he doesn’t know why Tanjiro didn’t get burned by Nezuko’s flames when he and his threads but doesn’t dwell on it. He declares he can now carve him to pieces without a second thought. As Tanjiro thinks using the right technique can help him despite being exhausted, Lower Five draws a web in his hands and uses Blood Demon Art: Murderous Eye Basket. Blood threads begin to encircle Tanjiro; he desperately tries to calm himself and use his breathing technique but finds he is unable to even raise his arm. As the threads close in on him, they slice both his hands and shred his uniform. Before Tanjiro can be killed, Giyu enters the battle and slices apart the blood thread web, saving him. As Tanjiro weakly sees someone has saved him, believing it to be Zenitsu, Giyu commends him for holding out till his arrival, leaving the battle to him. Upon seeing him, Rui angrily denounces the Demon Slayers as “an endless stream of lowlifes always getting in my way”. Using Blood Demon Art: Cutting Thread Rotation, he forms a spinning web of blood threads and launches it at his attacker. Giyu nonchalantly defeats Rui Giyu responds with Water Breathing, Eleventh Form: Dead Calm and ceases all movement. As Tanjiro watches, not knowing an eleventh form existed, Rui deems his technique irrelevant. As the rotating web reaches Giyu, it suddenly breaks apart before it can hit him. Confused, since he wasn’t moving when the attack got to him, the demon tries again but is easily decapitated by the Hashira in the time he has blinked. Elsewhere, Daughter continues to run away, muttering that this is the only time she had messed up in her role in Rui’s pretend family. She remembers the time when she first met the Lower Rank; she had been chased by several Demon Slayers and cornered at a large house in a clearing. As they prepared to kill her, they see another demon on the roof, Rui himself. He spoke to her and asked if she wanted him to save her, asking her to obey his wishes in return. She quickly agreed to his offer; to become a part of his family. As the Demon Slayers closed in on them, Rui takes hold of several threads within the clearing, slicing them to pieces. As she looks behind her, seeing her assailants now dead, she hears something within the house; a large group of spider-like demons. The Lower Rank takes her hand and welcomes her into the family. Inside the house, her initiation to join begins, with Rui and one of his older sisters present. As the most powerful demon in the house, he is the one to give strength to the others through his blood. Using a thread, he draws a drop of blood and adds it into a solution to be drunk. Daughter is offered the liquid by her new sister, who adds that Rui is allowed to share his strength being one of “that person's"" favourites. After taking it, Daughter is suddenly racked with intense pain as the Lower Rank’s blood begins to affect her; Rui asks if she feels it, stating she no longer needs to fear the Demon Slayers. He then gives the “finishing touches”, grabbing the demon’s face and ripping it off as she screams in agony. Mother punished by Rui At the end of her initiation, Daughter sees her appearance has now changed, with Rui congratulating her and recognizing the demon as part of his family now. In her first family ""dinner”, everyone sits down in a candle-lit room and pretends to partake in a meal, with Rui satisfied by the feeling of family. Later on, Daughter’s older sister informs her they all have no blood ties and are all strangers to one another. Outside, she sees Rui torturing a young demon. She apologizes to him and claims she will do better, telling him it is only accidental she reverts to her usual appearance. Instead, the Lower Rank ties a thread to her neck in anger, causing her to bleed. He eventually releases his hold and mutters, “I don’t want to hear your excuses, Mother”, as she transforms back into her spider-like appearance; he tells Mother to play her given role as she should and she quietly obeys his orders. Her sister states they were all scared of the Demon Slayers and simply wanted company, and that they never wanted to be part of his “family”. But those who disobeyed him were met with severe reprimand. She states she has had enough of playing his game and offers a plan to escape with Daughter, claiming she is the only one she doesn’t see as foolish and recognizing her as a real sister. The next day, when Rui is summoned by Muzan to descend the mountain, Daughter and her sister run away together to escape the forest. Rui punishes a sibling for attempting to escape. As they make their way down the mountain, they are met by Rui standing in their path; fearing the consequences, Daughter leaves her sister’s side and stands with him. In retaliation, Rui slices his older sister throughout her body with his threads, leaving her restrained at the top of the house to burn in the sunlight. Seeing her bloody body strewn with slashes from head to toe, he only mutters his disappointment in her and coldly walks away, with Daughter following him. As dawn breaks, the demon is hit by sunlight and subsequently burns to death. Daughter remembers that day, admonishing her and all her deceased family members as fools. Regardless, she acknowledges her own mistake, reminiscing on the moment she last met with Rui. She informs him that both Mother and their older brother have been killed, with the Demon Slayers closing in on them. As she proposes they escape, her eyes change back slightly to their original look. Rui notices this and angrily slashes her face, reminding her of his dislike when it happens, leading to Tanjiro’s confrontation with him. As she continues to run through the forest, she catches sight of a Demon Slayer. Murata sees Daughter but she quickly encases him in a web cocoon before he could attack. He tries to stab through but fails to cut the silk; to his shock, acid begins to seep through the silk. She describes how it will dissolve his clothes first, then his body, and she will then devour the remains afterwards. Shinobu evades Daughter's attack In an instant, Shinobu appears behind her, asking if her silk comes through her palms. In shock, Daughter only stands in silence as Shinobu bids the demon “Good Evening”, commenting on the moon’s appearance. She quickly launches ropes of silk at the Hashira but Shinobu skilfully evades her attack and pins her to the ground. Shinobu sees she has no intention to befriend her; Daughter begs her to listen and claims she is being forced by “him”, stating she will be killed if she disobeys his orders. Shinobu seemingly accepts her plea and offers to spare her, only to add that she must ask her a question beforehand. Shinobu calmly asks how many people she's killed; frightened, Daughter quietly answers, “Five”, as she begins to tear up, stating she was ordered to do so. Shinobu tells the demon she does not need to lie, as she already knows how many. She comments on the impressive attack that is her cocoons and claims that she has devoured at least eighty people. Daughter denies this and repeats she only killed five. Shinobu then informs her that as she came from west of the mountain, she saw hordes of cocoons in the trees, mentioning she counted fourteen in one spot alone, all human captives now dead. The Hashira states she isn’t angry but simply getting an accurate toll; Daughter asks what good will it be to be accurate and Shinobu states it is for her to get the proper penalty, “so you and I can become friends”. She threatens to gouge out her eyeballs, disembowel her body and torture her for each of her victims, and that only after suffering will she be forgiven. Horrified, the demon begins to panic, and Shinobu slyly replies she won’t die being a demon. Shinobu's Butterfly Dance: Caprice. Daughter attacks her with a wave of silk but Shinobu easily evades the attack, pitying her and their inability to become friends. When she attempts to attack again, she sees Shinobu has vanished. Daughter looks up and sees Shinobu lunging at her from the sky; as she gets close, the demon suddenly sees herself engulfed in a flutter of butterflies. One lands on her finger but it begins to bleed, with her body suddenly bleeding as well. Shinobu has attacked Daughter with Insect Breathing, Butterfly Dance: Caprice. Daughter grabs her neck but sees that she isn't beheaded, noticing her blade isn’t shaped to cut and concluding she is too weak to behead demons. Daughter's death at the hands of Shinobu's poison. As she sees Shinobu as someone she can beat, her body suddenly changes; blood vessels burst and her body begins to convulse. Finally, Daughter is hit by a sudden wave of pain and falls over. Hearing the body slump to the ground, Shinobu tells her not to feel safe when realizing she isn’t beheaded, as there are Demon Slayers who use poison. Twirling her blade in a display of skill, she states that of the Demon Slayer Corps, she is “Insect Hashira, Shinobu Kocho”; despite being the only one unable to behead demons, she is still “rather awesome” for using poison to kill. Shinobu cuts open Daughter’s last cocoon, freeing and saving Murata. He asks if she will finish off the demon but Shinobu states she is already dead from her wisteria poison. She happily notes that while Murata’s clothes have dissolved, his body is unscathed, leading him to slink away in embarrassment. She then turns her attention to the demon supposedly forcing Daughter, wondering if Giyu had beaten her to it. Rui sees the genuine bond of family. As Tanjiro makes his way to Nezuko, Rui’s severed head falls, still wanting to kill the siblings. Internally, he sees Mother asking what are his intentions with his “family”. He states he isn’t sure but that he has no human memories. Mother asks if that is why he made them pretend to be his. Rui believed he could regain them if he felt a familial bond. He sees Tanjiro hugging Nezuko and realizes he did everything to get what they have.

21,Against Corps Rules,Rui when he was human,"On a winter day, a young boy watches as children play in the snowy streets. As he approaches them, he falls to the ground and struggles to breathe. He turns over and looks to the sky, shortly as a woman tends to the boy; her son Rui. His mother scolds him as he knows he isn’t meant to be outside. Muzan when he met Rui Rui recalls his past; from his birth, he had always been frail. He couldn’t even run as walking was challenging for him, until Muzan appeared before him one night. The Demon Progenitor “pitied” him and offered a way to save him. His parents soon learned what became of their son. Despite now possessing a physically strong body, he could no longer be in sunlight and had to devour humans to sustain himself. He remembers when his father and mother first discovered when he ate someone; his father in utter disbelief and shock, while his mother cried in devastation. Rui thinks back to a story he heard growing up, about a man who died attempting to save his drowning son, and how he was so moved by an act of deep parental love and such a close bond; to him, that man had fulfilled his role as a parent. Subsequently, he never understood why his parents tried to kill him. One night, as he slept, his father raised a knife to his son, while his mother did nothing to prevent it and sobbed next to the bedroom. Rui listens to his mother's apology Rui awoke and mortally wounded them in retaliation. Afterwards, he sat on the porch of his house as he reasoned that his parents were imposters, not believing they had a bond. As he sat there, he hears his mother’s last words, an apology for not giving him a strong body. When she died, he suddenly remembers his father’s last spoken words to him: “It’s all right, Rui. We’re going to die with you”. Rui was so enraged at his father’s attempt to kill him, he ignored his last message; he was willing to die with him to atone for his murder of another person. Realizing then that they did have a genuine bond, he laments that he had severed it himself. Muzan then came to him and pushed the contrary, telling the young demon it was the fault of his parents for their inability to accept him. Devastated by what he had done, Rui forced himself to believe his words, unable to bear the weight of his act. As he dies, Rui’s headless body walks to Tanjiro; even as he understood that he was solely to blame, Rui missed his parents every single day since. Even after creating a fake family, the feeling of emptiness never left him, and because he was the most powerful demon in his family, no one could protect him. As Giyu watches, Rui’s disintegrating body makes its way to the injured Demon Slayer; Rui states that as he got more powerful, he remembered even less about being human, and as he did, he lost sight of what he wanted; to seek a bond he could never claim. Rui falls just short of Tanjiro as he continues to fade, and he tries in vain to reach out to him. Tanjiro looks at the body and detects the scent of unbearable grief. He gently touches the Lower Rank, the demon experiencing the feeling of warm, gentle sunlight. Rui remembers that he wanted to apologize to his parents, hoping they could forgive him. Nonetheless, he knows that killing scores of people will bring him to Hell anyway, denying him the chance at forgiveness from his parents. Rui is reunited with his parents In the afterlife, a voice reassures Rui: “We’ll be going together even if it’s to Hell."" Shocked to see his father with him, his mother then appears. She comforts her son, “No matter where you go, we’ll be with you."" Rui’s appearance changes back to when he was human as he hugs his parents. He tearfully apologizes for everything he had done, as the fires of Hell consume their souls; the last physical remnants of Lower Rank Five now gone. As Tanjiro watches Rui’s body fade away completely, he is shocked to see Giyu stepping on his clothes. The Hashira scolds him from showing sympathy to a demon, telling him it is irrelevant it looked like a child since it is a hideous monster that has lived for decades. Tanjiro responds that to avenge those killed by demons and prevent more victims, he will kill without mercy, but to demons who despaired and regretted their actions, he would never trample on them because they were human too, begging Giyu to step off Rui's clothes. He claims that demons are not hideous monsters but tragic and hopeless creatures. As Giyu looks at him and sees Nezuko as well, he suddenly remembers the two from their encounter years ago. GIyu protects Tanjiro and Nezuko At that moment, butterflies surround Giyu, though he quickly understands the situation and lowers his stance. From the trees, Shinobu speeds in and attempt to kill Nezuko; Giyu quickly blocks her blade and she becomes confused. She asks why he interrupt her attack after stating himself that demons and humans could never get along, further stating that is why he is disliked. Elsewhere, a transformed Demon Slayer is given a dosage of medication and the poison quickly disappears. The person who administered it, a man wearing clothes titled “Kakushi”, exclaims his amazement at its effectiveness, as it is Shinobu’s own making, while his female partner adds that Shinobu had it determined after one look of the situation. She calls the Hashira amazing but also claims that Zenitsu is too, as he is brought down the suspended house; he had killed the demon responsible and its death had slowed the poison’s circulation slightly. The Kakushi applies a sign to his patient explaining his finished treatment and gladly states that all those affected can recover, while the female Kakushi comments that it is wise to pack up and leave the scene quickly. As Tanjiro looks at Shinobu’s unusual blade, she asks Giyu to move again. He responds that he isn’t disliked by people, to Tanjiro and Shinobu’s surprise. She gives an apology and states she is unaware he has not realized it, to Giyu’s chagrin and Tanjiro’s further shock at the situation. She calls out to Tanjiro and tries to tell him he is protecting a demon; Tanjiro states he is aware but adds that the demon is his little sister. Shinobu’s way of showing pity is offering a gentle toxin to kill her without pain, worrying him. Giyu asks if he can move, then instructs him to take his sister and run. Without hesitating, Tanjiro thanks him, takes Nezuko and flees. Shinobu claims that is against the Corps rules but Giyu ignores her. With Nezuko in his arms, Tanjiro runs far away through the forest, taking his box upon spotting it. Despite being in intense physical pain, he forces himself to keep running. As Nezuko awakens, he wonders if he must quit the Demon Slayer Corps, as they would surely not allow a swordsman to travel with a demon; unbeknownst to Tanjiro, someone is pursuing him through the trees. Shinobu weaving through the forest Shinobu and Giyu clash swords, with her in disbelief at a Hashira protecting a demon. When Giyu doesn’t say a word, she decides to leave him to avoid stalling time, before leaping into the trees to hunt down Nezuko. Shinobu daintily weaves through the forest as Giyu chases her from the ground, sarcastically ask if that is how he will catch up to her. She leaps high into the sky and states she is willing to let him try and stop her; at this, Giyu leaps towards Shinobu with great height, much to her surprise. Nezuko evades the Demon Slayer As Tanjiro continues to make his way down Mount Natagumo, a girl descends from behind him and lands on his back, causing him to fall down and lose hold of his sister. He sees Nezuko but also sees another Demon Slayer has appeared as well; before she can behead Nezuko, Tanjiro grabs the girl’s cloak to make her lose balance. He tells Nezuko to run but is knocked unconscious by the Demon Slayer.  She gets up and attempts to behead the demon but Nezuko shrinks down to avoid the swing. Confused at her attempt to escape her, the girl chases her down but repeatedly misses her slashes as Nezuko evades them. She notes that she isn’t attacking back but decides not to think about it, given the one task to kill demons. Shinobu restrained by Giyu Meanwhile, Shinobu attempts to talk to Giyu while being restrained by him; she states what she did is a clear and justified attempt to kill a demon and asks what were his intentions when he caused her attack to miss. When Giyu doesn’t say anything again, Shinobu firmly asks again and gives him a warning. He states it was because of something that happened two years ago but Shinobu doesn’t understand it, asking him not to ramble about something in the past. She questions if he is being spiteful because she had pointed out he is disliked by people, annoying Giyu again. Shinobu attempts to escape his hold by deploying a blade in her shoe, but before she can bend back to strike him, a Kasugai Crow announces a message, stopping her just short of hitting his face. The crow gives a message from headquarters; Tanjiro and Nezuko are to be taken into custody and brought back. Another crow announces a description of the two; Tanjiro is clad in a checkered haori, with a scar on his forehead, while Nezuko is a demon wearing a bamboo muzzle. The Demon Slayer chasing the two hears this and asks Nezuko on her identity. Giyu and Shinobu sheath their swords and leave Mount Natagumo, while Tanjiro is found by Kakushi going by his description from the crow. Another pair of Kakushi find Inosuke still tied to the tree, but are wary after seeing his boar mask. They eventually discover he is indeed a Demon Slayer and take him down, while shocked at the extent of his injuries; as he is taken away, Inosuke mutters to himself about his inability to kill even a single demon and begins to doubt himself. Tanjiro is rescued by the Kakushi Elsewhere, Zenitsu, with Chuntaro as company, has finished his treatment and put alongside the other treated Demon Slayers. He wonders about the Kakushi and comments on their speed and efficiency. He sees the girl giving orders and recognizes her as a survivor in Final Selection. The girl tells the Kakushi to bring the wounded to her place, the so-called Butterfly Mansion, while she hunts demons around the forest to protect them. Zenitsu then remember who the Kakushi are; they serve as clean up crews after battles with demons, and are composed of people without skills in swordsmanship. Dawn breaks over Mount Natagumo as everyone leaves the forest; Tanjiro now asleep on a Kakushi’s back. Tanjiro before the Hashiras. Tanjiro, still asleep, lies on a stone garden when a Kakushi commands him to wake up. He jolts awake and finds himself before several swordsman; the Kakushi telling him he is in the presence of the Hashira.

22,Master of the Mansion,"Tanjiro is put on trial by the Hashira for violating Corps rules by protecting a demon. And the Wind Hashira, Sanemi Shinazugawa, draws his sword against Nezuko…[1]","Tanjiro lies before the Hashira. In an unknown location, an unconscious and restrained Tanjiro lies in a stone garden. A Kakushi commands him to wake up and he jolts up to see swordsmen before him. One of them speaks of his disappointment in seeing him, having heard a Demon Slayer was travelling with a demon and believing they would be someone flamboyant. Another decides they should all put him on trial. A girl among them is stunned to see him protecting his demon sibling, amazed by their sibling love. When Tanjiro tries to ask who they are, the Kakushi pushes his head into the ground, telling him not to speak as he is in the presence of the Hashira. Confused at what a Hashira is, Shinobu, who is among them, tells him he is in the Demon Slayer Headquarters and will now be put on trial. The Sound Hashira offers to kill Tanjiro ""flamboyantly"". Shinobu asks Tanjiro to explain his crime but is interrupted by the loud and proud Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku; he states it is a clear violation to protect a demon and they are allowed to dispense justice. He is joined by the eccentric Sound Hashira, Tengen Uzui. He offers to decapitate Tanjiro “flamboyantly” and proclaims he will show “the most flamboyant blood spray you’ll ever see”. Meanwhile, the Love Hashira, Mitsuri Kanroji, is hesitant to kill “such an adorable child” and is unwilling to act. Gyomei Himejima, the hulking Stone Hashira, instead sees him as pitiful and pities that he was born. The Mist Hashira on the other hand, Muichiro Tokito, is looking and wondering at the shape of a cloud in the sky, ignoring the situation. Obanai asking Giyu if he has anything to say in his defense. When Tanjiro looks around the garden, the Kakushi asks him why is he ignoring the Hashira, stating they are the nine most powerful swordsmen in the Demon Slayer Corps. Gyomei decides they should kill him and his decision is joined by  Kyojuro and Tengen. Tanjiro looks for Nezuko, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and Murata but is unable to see them. One Hashira instead wants to question Giyu; Tanjiro looks into the trees and sees someone, who states he is annoyed at seeing him unrestrained as Shinobu said that Giyu had violated the rules as well. He is the Serpent Hashira, the cold and harsh Obanai Iguro. Obanai asks how can they punish him and asks Giyu if he has anything to say to defend his actions. Giyu, revealed as the Water Hashira, doesn’t respond to Obanai's question. Shinobu, the Insect Hashira herself, insist they can deal with him later since he willingly came along. Instead, she is curious about Tanjiro’s story, wanting an explanation despite the clear violation of the rules. She plainly asks him why he is travelling with a demon as a Demon Slayer. Though he is given ample time to explain, Tanjiro attempts to say who the demon is but then struggles to speak and breathe. Shinobu gives him medicated water to help with the pain; she asks him not to push himself as his wounds have not healed yet. Tanjiro tells his story; the demon is his younger sister. When he was away, his family was attacked by a demon and Nezuko was transformed. Despite this, she has never devoured anyone. Obanai states that if she's family then he will obviously defend her and doesn’t believe his claims. Gyomei, upon hearing that she was transformed, adds that they must kill her too, “so that she can be liberated”. Tanjiro begs them to listen and explains he became a swordsman to find a cure for Nezuko, adding that she has not devoured anyone for two years. Tengen retorts that his story lacks anything flare and if he is going to plea his case, he should spice it up a bit. Mitsuri remains unsure of the situation. Tengen demands him to prove himself “with max flamboyance”. Muichiro ignores them, instead looking and wondering about a bird he sees flying above him. However, Mitsuri is unsure they can proceed, not believing “the Master” is unaware of the situation and asking if they can act without his permission. Seeing them still unwilling to listen, Tanjiro claims she can fight alongside him in battle and protect people as a Demon Slayer. They are then joined by someone carrying Nezuko’s box. He enjoys the tense situation and insults Tanjiro as ""the moron Demon Slayer with a demon”. The Wind Hashira, the aggressive and brash Sanemi Shinazugawa, bluntly asks what he is trying to do. Tanjiro head butts Sanemi. A Kakushi begs him to put down the box and Shinobu gets up, with Mitsuri seeing her unusually angry. Shinobu asks him not to step out of line. Instead, Sanemi claims Tanjiro’s statement about her fighting to protect humans is a “total delusion”, manically drawing his sword and stabbing into the box, wounding Nezuko in the shoulder. Tanjiro gets up and claims he will not let anyone hurt Nezuko, Hashira or not. Sanemi mocks his threats, causing Tanjiro to run towards him. Giyu then announces that the Master is arriving; shocked, Sanemi loses concentration and misses his swing, allowing Tanjiro to leap into the air and head butt him square in the forehead, knocking him down. The Master of the Hashira. Everyone is shocked to see someone attack Sanemi; Obanai mentally notes that Giyu's outburst was likely a distraction, but Tanjiro still managed to get a blow in and is impressed. Tanjiro stands in front of the box and claims he should quit being a Hashira if he can’t see the difference between good and bad demons. Sanemi grabs his blade and threatens to kill him when they are interrupted by the Master’s arrival. A blind and sickly looking man appears; guided by his two aides, he makes his way before the Hashira. The Master comments on the nice weather and states he is pleased they have made it to their semi-annual meeting. Tanjiro wonders about the man’s appearance and well-being but is suddenly pushed to the ground by Sanemi. He then sees the other Hashira bowing to the Master. Sanemi eloquently offers him greetings, pleased about seeing him in good health and wishing good fortune through continual prayers, to which a dismayed Mitsuri mutters that she wanted to offer her own similar greetings to the Master. Sanemi asks him about Tanjiro, who is shocked to see him speak with formal vocabulary when he initially appeared brutish. The Master apologizes to them for the situation but unexpectedly reveals he has sanctioned Tanjiro and Nezuko's circumstances, adding that he would like them to accept it as well. Gyomei states he cannot agree, despite knowing it is the Master’s intention. Tengen concurs with him but Mitsuri quickly accepts his wishes. Muichiro states that he is likely to forget either way, so he will be fine either way. Shinobu and Giyu remain silent, Obanai remains distrustful of the siblings, and Kyojuro exuberantly opposes the Master’s decision. Sanemi requests for both Tanjiro and Giyu to be punished. A letter from the former Water Hashira Sakonji Urokodaki. With his answers, the Master asks for one of his aides to read a letter. She explains this letter was given by a former Hashira, Sakonji Urokodaki. Reading an abridged version, the letter explains his wish for permission to be granted that would allow Tanjiro to be with Nezuko. Due to her resilient mental strength, she hasn’t lost her human emotions. Nezuko has never devoured anyone for two years, even while injured. Sakonji explains that in the aftermath of when she does attack someone, Tanjiro, himself, and Giyu will atone by committing seppuku. Tanjiro tears up seeing Giyu after learning of his willingness and devotion to protecting Nezuko. Sanemi rejects their promise and states they can die regardless, adding that it guarantes nothing. Kyojuro agrees and comments that her killing a human is irreversible. The Master agrees that it isn’t sure she won’t attack but adds that it is also unsure that she will, citing the fact that Nezuko has refrained for two years. With three people risking their lives for her cause, the Master implores the Hashira to try a more convincing argument; at this, Sanemi and Kyojuro grow hesitant. The Hashira learn that Tanjiro has met Muzan Kibutsuji. The Master then adds one important fact; Tanjiro has met Muzan Kibutsuji. The Hashira are in disbelief, with Tengen even stating that they have not crossed paths with him. He asks Tanjiro about his appearance and powers, with Muichiro asking if he fought him. Sanemi’s way of asking involves handling Tanjiro’s head by his hair and bombarding him with questions. When he and Tengen raise their voices in an argument, the Master calmly signals for them to be silent, leading the Hashira to cease their questioning and silence themselves. He states that Muzan had sent demons after Tanjiro; though it may be simply to kill him, the fact that he had revealed himself for the first time cannot go unnoticed. The Master also believes that something happened to Nezuko that even surprised the Demon Progenitor. He asks if the Hashira understand their importance but they don’t respond. Sanemi speaks up and disagrees; he bluntly states that if Nezuko were still human then he would have no problem with sparing her, but it is completely unacceptable to let a demon live much less house one, especially not with all the Demon Slayers have gone through and the countless lives of humans lost because of demons. He suddenly draws his sword and slices his forearm, shocking everyone. Sanemi aims to prove a demon’s true nature in front of the Master. He allows his blood to drop onto Nezuko’s box and taunts her, the blood seeping through the wood and falling on her hand, causing the demon to groan. Sanemi goads Nezuko with his own blood. As Tanjiro calls out to her, Obanai adds that it might not be wise to do it in the sunlight, advising him to do it in the shade. Sanemi apologizes to the Master for his discourtesy and leaps into the Headquarters, before proceeding to stab Nezuko again. Tanjiro calls out to Nezuko but Obanai leaps up and slams his elbow into his back to hold him down. Sanemi stabs her a third time and opens the box. In front of everyone, Nezuko emerges from the box and stares at Sanemi, salivating after smelling his blood.

He goads her into attacking him, waving the scent of blood in her face as the rest of the Hashiras watch. Shinobu notices that Obanai is driving his elbow harder into Tanjiro’s back and asks him to ease up, though he claims it is to stop him from moving. She warns Tanjiro not to use breathing techniques while his lungs are being pressed down or his veins could burst; Tengen hears this and happily asks for it to happen: “I like it! Sounds flamboyant!”, much to Mitsuri's concern. Gyomei calls Tanjiro a weak, pathetic child and pities his soul. As Nezuko struggles to hold herself together, to Sanemi’s enjoyment, Tanjiro forces himself to breathe and successfully breaks his restraints, shocking Shinobu and Obanai. As he runs to his sister, Obanai is grabbed by Giyu to stop him from interfering. Knowing he cannot physically stop Nezuko, Tanjiro calls out to his sister. Nezuko sees herself back in the snowy forest where she transformed, with herself and Tanjiro at Giyu’s mercy. She hears his plea that she is different from other demons. More memories of her family appear and she suddenly hears Sakonji Urokodaki's message to her: “Protect humans”, and she recalls the words as Tanjiro appears in front of her. “Humans are to be protected and saved. I will never hurt them."" Nezuko resists Sanemi's blood. In front of everyone, Nezuko turns away from Sanemi’s blood and resists the temptation, to his shock and Tanjiro’s relief. The Master, being blind, asks what happened; his aide informs him that Nezuko has rejected Sanemi’s taunting , and despite being stabbed three times was able to restrain herself. He is pleased that it is proven she won’t attack humans. Obanai pulls his hand away from Giyu and demands to know what he is doing. The Master then speaks to Tanjiro; he informs the Demon Slayer that there will be those who will still not accept Nezuko and ask him to prove to them, that he and Nezuko can fight as Demon Slayers. Tanjiro quickly bows down as he hears his words, noting the floating feeling and calming voice of the Master. He tells the boy to defeat a Twelve Kizuki and prove his worth, allowing others to accept and take him seriously. Tanjiro vows that he and Nezuko will defeat Muzan Kibutsuji without fail, though the Master implores him to start small with a Twelve Kizuki, still being ill-equipped. Caught up in his confidence, Tanjiro embarrassedly agrees, to Mitsuri and Shinobu’s laughter. The Master tells him that the Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps are phenomenally skilled and have defied death through hellish training and defeating Twelve Kizuki demons. He states they receive special treatment and kindly asks him to mind his manners when speaking. Tanjiro acknowledges their importance and agrees with his message. Finally, the Master addresses Sanemi and Obanai, gently asking not to torment those weaker than them too much; though hesitant, the two nonetheless agree to his wishes and acknowledge them. Tanjiro interupts the Hashira meeting. With Tanjiro’s trial finished, Shinobu steps up and offers to take both siblings to her house. She signals for them to take them away, though a Kakushi is hesitant to approach Nezuko. Another one quickly bows to the Master and the Hashiras, before grabbing Tanjiro and quickly leaving the scene, with the second Kakushi in tow with Nezuko’s box. As the Hashira meeting is about to commence, Tanjiro unexpectedly interrupts them and asks for the Master’s permission to head butt Sanemi again. The Kakushi pin him down and demand him to be quiet but he wishes to head butt him as many times as he had stabbed Nezuko, reasoning that it isn’t against the Corp rules. As he continues to struggle against the Kakushi’s hold, three pebbles fly towards Tanjiro without warning, hitting him in the head and knocking him down. Muichiro, who flung them, tells him not to interrupt the Master; the Kakushi repeatedly bow in apology to the Master and Muichiro, while Mitsuri is amazed at him being “so cool”. As Tanjiro is taken away a second time, the Master asks him to “give Miss Tamayo my regards”, stunning the Demon Slayer. As they run away from the headquarters, Tanjiro tells the Kakushi he heard him mention Tamayo’s name. Instead, the female Kakushi demands him to be quiet and punishes him, frightened from being yelled at by the Hashira. She and the male Kakushi tell him what he has done is unforgivable and demand an apology, leaving him to quietly apologize. Kanao Tsuyuri. The Kakushi eventually reach Shinobu’s house, the Butterfly Mansion, but find no one at the front. They decide to walk to the back; the man carrying Tanjiro tells him to walk on his own, but he responds that his body is still aching. He sees the numerous butterflies giving its name and they eventually see a young girl in the back. The Kakushi see her and realize she is a Tsuguko. Her name is Kanao Tsuyuri; Tanjiro suddenly recognizes her as the sole girl who survived Final Selection. He tells the Kakushi this but he doesn’t believe him, perhaps believing he had forgotten it was Kanao who knocked him unconscious on Mount Natagumo. He tells Tanjiro she is a Tsuguko; a swordsman trained by a Hashira, and that only those with amazing skills and talent get to be chosen. The female Kakushi approaches Kanao and informs her they arrived under Shinobu’s orders. Upon asking for permission to enter, she is ignored by Kanao not speaking a word. Slightly confused, she asks Kanao if she minds but receives no answer again. Suddenly, a loud voice asks who they are, startling the Kakushi and Tanjiro. The girl who called out to them sees they are Kakushi and directs them into the mansion. Inside the hospital ward, Zenitsu discovers he must take terrible tasting medication five times a day for three months, to the concern of an attendant. Though he knows his arms and legs can heal by taking it, he still demands to know how and why. The girl leading the Kakushi sees him complaining loudly again, while Tanjiro is relieved to see his friend again. Zenitsu is scolded for complaining again. The girl angrily reminds him he has been explained numerous times previously to take his medication and threatens to tie him up should he complain again, before walking away. Tanjiro asks if Zenitsu is okay, realizing he truly did enter the forests of Mount Natagumo. Zenitsu loudly retells how he was stung by a spider and is now being yelled at by that girl. Tanjiro looks at him closer and if he had gotten “smaller”; Zenitsu responds by speaking about his near transformation into a spider, as snot hangs from his nose to the Kakushi he had crying on, disgusting him. Tanjiro asks about Inosuke and Murata’s whereabouts. Zenitsu doesn’t know who Murata is but points to Inosuke, who is lying in the bed next to him. Inosuke despondent over his weakness. Tanjiro gets off the Kakushi’s back, crawls to Inosuke’s bed, and apologizes for being unable to rescue him. Answering in a weak and coarse voice, Inosuke tells him it is fine and not to worry about it. Tanjiro is shocked to hear him speak and Zenitsu answers with how he heard about him losing his voice through being hit in the neck and yelling at the top of his lungs, but remains unsure of the details. He then states that Inosuke being depressed has made him calm and gentle, to Zenitsu’s delight, leading Tanjiro to ask why he is laughing creepily. Inosuke apologizes for being weak, leading both of them to give words of encouragement, Tanjiro stating that he is happy just to see him alive. Suddenly, Zenitsu worriedly asks if they had seen him take his morning medication, unwilling to taste it again and yelling at his misery. With him and his friends in bed and resting, Tanjiro speaks of his thankfulness to see them alive. As night begins to fall, he closes his curtains and opens Nezuko’s box, allowing her to walk out of the room she has been provided with. When he attempts to sit on the bed, Tanjiro hunches over in pain, leading him to realize how severely injured he got on Mount Natagumo. He thanks his sister for protecting him, stating it was not just her but Sakonji and Giyu risking their lives for them.  As he reaffirms his goal to get stronger, he thinks back to the Master, and how his voice seemed so soothing and made his head feel light. Nezuko eventually falls asleep, and Tanjiro promises to turn her back into a human once more. Kagaya Ubuyashiki speaks with the Hashira. That night, during the meeting at the Headquarters, the Master, Kagaya Ubuyashiki, meets with the Hashira to discuss the threat of demons; as they have reported, increasing damage caused by them will inevitably lead to human life under threat more than ever. Sanemi comments that the incident on Mount Natagumo has shown that the skill of Demon Slayers has plummeted greatly, deeming most of them useless. When he wonders whether the trainers could tell if someone could at least be competent, Tengen jokingly reminds him that Tanjiro landed “that flamboyant blow on you”, earning his ire. Shinobu adds that as the human population grows, it would become harder to unify them all. Gyomei states that since only those whose loved ones were killed by demons choose to join the Corps, or have done so through generations, they can’t simply have people without the drive or resolve to do so join them and would be cruel to ask such of laymen. Kyojuro chimes in that Tanjiro encountering a Twelve Kizuki only months after joining could mean he has the power to draw them, envious since even they rarely get to face them. Kagaya notes that Lower Five’s drastic actions mean that Muzan isn’t near Mount Natagumo, referring to the incident in Asakusa and how he draws attention to cover his tracks. Kagaya vows to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji. Though frustrated at how demons continue to freely devour humans and get stronger, Kagaya expressed his faith in them, believing he has assembled the strongest Hashiras since the feudal era. One by one, he says the names of all the Hashiras and states he looks forward to their success, addressing the swordsmen as his “children”. After the meeting, left alone to himself, Kagaya swears that he will defeat Muzan Kibutsuji, even if it’s the last thing he’ll do, and that they will bring him down without fail.

24,Rehabilitation Training,"The injured Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke are sent to the Insect Hashira Shinobu Kocho’s mansion for treatment. When Tanjiro and Inosuke start their rehabilitation training two weeks later, the drills are so brutal that they find themselves broken in spirit. Meanwhile, Zenitsu, unaware of the grueling regimen, becomes very enthusiastic to finally join the training when he sees all the girls, but...[1]","Shinobu chats with Kyojuro before his mission. As Kyojuro Rengoku prepares for a mission, he is met by Shinobu. He tells her information about a demon, with several Demon Slayers sent to kill it defeated. With the Corps losing personnel, they cannot stand by and do nothing. Shinobu wonders if it could be a Twelve Kizuki and Kyojuro says it is likely, adding that it could possibly even be an Upper Rank. She comments on the mission possibly being difficult but brushes aside her concern, confident in Kyojuro's abilities. He then asks her on what she will do about Tanjiro, mentioning that she had wanted more Tsugukos. Shinobu jokingly tells him not to worry as “it’s not as if I’ll gobble him up”. Kyojuro agrees and laughs heartily as he departs the Headquarters. As she watches him leave, she bids him to be careful. In the Butterfly Mansion, Zenitsu complains again about his medication. The head caretaker, Aoi Kanzaki, reminds him again that he is the most injured and demands that he take it now. Finding his antics unbelievable, Aoi turns to Tanjiro and provides him with his medication, handed to him by an helper. Tanjiro thanks her and drinks it, surprised by the pleasant taste. Zenitsu hears this and accuses Aoi of favouritism by giving him medicine that is easy to take. Tanjiro asks him to be quiet being in a hospital ward but hears a voice commenting that he looks well. Aoi demands Zenitsu to stop complaining. Murata appears, to Tanjiro’s relief, and they begin chatting. When asked if he is feeling alright, Murata comments that he was close to melting but is otherwise okay, though he adds that the same cannot be said for them. He tries to talk to Inosuke about his injured throat but Tanjiro tells him to let him be, having been through much. Zenitsu interrupts the conversation and asks who Murata is, to which Tanjiro states that he fought with them on Mount Natagumo. Murata asks about his arm and Zenitsu responds with how he nearly transformed into a spider, causing Aoi to jump in and remind him to take his medication, to his plight. Murata remembers his meeting with the Hashiras. Zenitsu tries to reason with her and claims, “there is only so much gross a person can take”, leading Aoi to respond not to come crying to her when his arms don’t return to normal. He responds that she is being too cold but she states that he has it easy; by taking the medication and getting plentiful sunlight, he won’t have to endure lasting effects. Zenitsu runs to Tanjiro, unwilling to take more of Aoi’s verbal lashing, only for Murata to sarcastically say they seem to be having fun, shocking the two with his despondent and frightful expression. He mentions how he was summoned to report the Mount Natagumo incident at the Hashira meeting, claiming that they are too terrifying. He speaks about how they were angered about the weaker new Demon Slayers because some of them didn’t follow orders on the mountain, and how he was unfairly asked so much for someone of his rank. As he speaks about how the Hashira terrify him, someone walks up behind Murata; the Insect Hashira herself. Frightened by Shinobu's sudden appearance, he quickly greets her and leaves the room in a hurry. Shinobu, amused by his scared reaction, asks Tanjiro about his recovery, and he responds he is feeling a lot better. Hearing this, she states he can now begin his Rehabilitation Training, involving him and Inosuke. Two weeks later, a recovered Zenitsu sits alone in his room, waiting for the two to finish. He comments on Shinobu’s unique voice and how it seems both irregular and slightly scary. Despite this, he remembers when she came to Mount Natagumo and how she seemed like a goddess to the transformed people, who came to her teary-eyed. An exhausted Tanjiro and Inosuke return. Zenitsu also comments on her pretty appearance, but as he begins to wonder about the “cute lady” taking his friends to help them regain stamina, he suddenly sees them enter the room, both extremely exhausted and despondent. The two slide into bed without saying anything, scaring Zenitsu as he knows he will be joining them tomorrow. The next day, he joins his friends in their Rehabilitation Training. With the two appearing to dread the next session, Zenitsu is nervous to commence. In a large room, Aoi explains to Zenitsu the three tests to help them rehabilitate. First, he will be stretched out to help his body from being in bed for so long; the process done by three helpers and demonstrated on Inosuke, who promptly tears up from the intense procedure. Kanao defeats Tanjiro at the reflexes test. The next station involves reflex training and Kanao Tsuyuri; on a table with cups of medicated water, the goal is to throw them onto their opponent before they can, but the opponent can block the cup to stop their throw. Tanjiro attempts this but promptly fails, with Kanao proving far too quick to defeat. In the third and last station, the goal is full-body training; simply a game of tag involving Aoi and Kanao Now informed, Zenitsu asks Aoi a question, before calling Tanjiro and Inosuke over. When they don’t move initially, Zenitsu angrily grabs the two and drags them outside the mansion. In the yard, he demands they listen to what he has to say and suddenly punches Inosuke into the wall. When Tanjiro checks over his friend and asks he apologize, Zenitsu instead tells them they need to apologize to him, for acting “like you’d come back from Hell when you were in Heaven!”. He asks why after “frolicking” with girls do they look so haggard, demanding them bow down, apologize and commit seppuku. When Tanjiro incredulously asks why he is saying something so absurd, Zenitsu yells at him to listen and grabs his hair, then proceeds to list the various things he enjoys about girls. Zenitsu goes insane with happiness and Inosuke criticizes him for not making sense, adding his own thoughts by claiming that losing to someone smaller than you destroys your soul. Zenitsu sarcastically pities him for not being with a girl because he lived on a mountain, angering the boar-headed Demon Slayer; Inosuke states he has been with girls, by stepping on them, with Zenitsu furiously telling him that’s how you don’t get girls. Inside the room, the entire argument is heard by the girls inside, much to their bewilderment. Aoi's disgust at Zenitsu's attempt at ""courtesy"". Back inside, Zenitsu enthusiastically asks to be trained, enjoying being stretched out as Tanjiro and Inosuke look at him dumbfounded. In the reflex test with Aoi, Zenitsu grabs his cup first but decides not to splash her to be ""courteous"", much to her chagrin. In the full-body training and facing Aoi again, Zenitsu uses his superior speed and grabs her, leading Aoi to punch him in the face; despite this, Zenitsu is satisfied holding her. Watching his success, Inosuke becomes re-motivated; he quickly beats Aoi in the reflexes test and grabs her by the legs in the full-body training, albeit hurting her. Kanao remains undefeated to the trio. With his friends able to best Aoi, Tanjiro begins to lag behind them and continually loses. Despite this, none of them are able to defeat Kanao. For the next five days of training, she continues to beat them without the trio able to challenge her at all, leading Zenitsu and Inosuke to stop attending the sessions. After one session, Tanjiro tries to think about how she is so fast, surmising that even going all-out wouldn’t mean success. He notes that she possesses a scent similar to the Hashira; as he thinks about Kanao, one of the attendants calls to him. He asks what they wanted to call him over for; at first, they seem hesitant, giving him a towel to dry himself with instead. He happily takes it; as he dries his wet hair, she asks if he maintains Total Concentration Breathing all day. Confusing him, she tells him to do so all day and night, even while asleep. Tanjiro states he does not, wondering whether it is even possible. one of them says it is and can make a big difference. He says even using the technique for a short time takes its toll on him; the girls respond by saying the Hashira and Kanao have already mastered it. They all tell him to work hard at it and he thanks them for the information. The next day, Inosuke and Zenitsu still refuse to join Tanjiro in training, with the former sulking over losing and the latter asking him to tell them he got re-injured. Outside on his own, Tanjiro makes the first attempt to use Total Concentration Breathing longer, before promptly collapsing in physical exhaustion. As he feels the agony of using it for extended time, he becomes startled by a loud sound in his eardrums. He thinks back to the basics and continues, with the three girls watching his progress. Later, as he is eating, the girls show him a set of gourds Shinobu had Kanao blow into to help her. Initially believing they are a strange instrument, Tanjiro becomes shocked to know Kanao actually makes them explode, tapping one and noting its very hard structure. He is aghast to learn a petite girl is able to do something so difficult and becomes more so upon seeing the gourds she is currently able to destroy, which are nearly as big as him. Tanjiro maintains Total Concentration Breathing after training. The next day, a dismayed Tanjiro tells Aoi that his friends won't be training again; though apologetic, she brushes aside his sincerity and tells him not to concern himself. Throughout the entire day, while re-doing the drills Sakonji Urokodaki had given him, Tanjiro works to maintain Total Concentration without stopping. He uses the mansion's obstacles as a training ground similar to Mount Fujikasane. Fifteen days later, Tanjiro's stamina has improved; he is able to run farther than ever before and can feel his lungs getting stronger. On the rooftop of the mansion, he focuses on slow breathing in the night, to counteract his rapid breathing during the day. He meditates to help concentration, as Sakonji had advised. He thinks of him and his smith Haganezuka, only to imagine the anger of the latter about his broken sword, something he isn't willing to go through. He loses concentration and tries again, only to hear a voice call to him. Shinobu converses with Tanjiro. Shinobu suddenly appears beside him, commending him for working hard while his friends are elsewhere, with Tanjiro blushing at the sight of the young woman. She asks if he feels lonely, and he responds he doesn't mind it, wanting to teach his friends after mastering the technique, earning her praise. He asks why she had brought them in; she states it is because of Nezuko's official recognition and due to the three being severely injured. Shinobu tells him she has wanted to entrust her dream to him, for demons to be friends with humans, and believing him capable of accomplishing it. Tanjiro suddenly senses something and turns to Shinobu. He asks if she is angry, shocking her; he says he senses an angry scent off of her despite her smiling. She confirms he is right and says she is perhaps always in a constant state of anger. Since the death of her sister by a demon and seeing the pain of others going through the same thing, her anger has only continued to build. She mentions that she and the other Hashiras all have a deep disgust for demons that they cannot fight. Shinobu remembers her sister's death. When they saw Nezuko and found she truly doesn't eat humans, they memorized her presence. It is only out of respect for Kagaya that they will not harm her. She talks about her older sister, who like Tanjiro was a kind-hearted person who was sympathetic to demons. Even till her death, she had pity for them; whereas she herself was unable to feel the same, asking how someone can pity for something that kills people. But since it was how her sister felt, Shinobu continues to carry the same feeling today. For her sister's memory, she has always tried to find a way not to kill demons but is exhausted by her efforts, believing demons are completely irredeemable. Shinobu asks Tanjiro to give his all and always protect Nezuko, adding that his unrelenting sympathy for demons in her place greatly reassures her and claiming she can now rest. Shinobu comments his Total Concentration breathing has stopped, surprising him, and she disappears. Shocked by her story, Tanjiro reasserts himself to continue working hard and regains focus on his Total Concentration Breathing. He remembers the murder of his family and uses his pain to push himself, remembering his promise to turn Nezuko back into a human.

25,"Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri","Tanjiro, who has been going through rehabilitation training at the Butterfly Mansion, works hard to keep up his Total Concentration Breathing all day long. Though at first, he's helpless against Kanao, a swordswoman in his class who’s training him, he slowly but surely begins to make some headway.","Seeing Tanjiro devote himself to training every single day, Zenitsu and Inosuke finally resume training as well, but…[1] The girls beat Tanjiro awake. To help him maintain Total Concentration Constant, Tanjiro enlists the help of the mansion’s three helpers; Naho, Kiyo, and Sumi. He gives the girls carpet beaters and instructs them to hit him if he ever stops his breathing technique whilst he is asleep. The girls agree to help him. Later that night, they watch Tanjiro in his bed and see he is still maintaining Total Concentration. Soon, he begins to snore, leading the girls to enthusiastically beat him awake, startling him. While being watched by Zenitsu, Tanjiro tries again to maintain Total Concentration; at first, he succeeds again in doing so whilst asleep, only to end up snoring again, to which the girls beat him awake again as told, causing him to ask for another attempt. In the morning, Aoi is dismayed to see Tanjiro as the only one training; he apologizes and claims he asked his friends to come but his concern is brushed aside by her. He continues to train and feels himself getting used to doing it while maintaining Total Concentration. Even though he cannot sustain it unless he pushes himself, Tanjiro is nonetheless able to do it longer due to his boost in stamina. The next day, in a full-body training exercise and facing Kanao, he is able to keep up with her, much to the Tsuguko's surprise. Despite this, his attempt to grab her hand fails when she dodges in the nick of time, though she is stunned to see him now able to challenge her. At the end of the day, Tanjiro thanks Aoi but she suddenly glances away in discontent; Zenitsu and Inosuke peer behind the doorway at them but walk away to refuse training again when he calls out to them, with Aoi speaking of her refusal to get involved. Training with the small gourd and cheered on by Naho, Sumi, and Kiyo, Tanjiro successfully breaks it open with his breath, to their amazement. With only the large gourd left, he celebrates with the girls and thanks them for helping him; Zenitsu and Inosuke watch him unseen, with Zenitsu shocked to see his friend’s increased strength. Zenitsu is encouraged by Chuntaro to persevere. The next morning, Zenitsu sees Tanjiro has already left his bed to train, and Inosuke is still asleep. He mutters to himself about persevering isn’t who he is and how it’s draining to do it daily. Chuntaro appears next to him; Zenitsu speaks to him about how despite the feeling of being left behind panics him, he is unable to learn what Tanjiro is doing despite being shown. He claims he and Inosuke are a lost cause; Chuntaro chirps in agreement, annoying Zenitsu. He asks the sparrow if it would kill him to be nice and Chuntaro tells him to work harder. Realizing there is no way around it, Zenitsu takes the first step to improve and takes his medication, albeit still grossed out. Inosuke suddenly awakens beside him and only mutters, “Come on, Monitsu”. The two consult Shinobu and she says what Tanjiro is training to do is a skill called Total Concentration, Constant, and that by maintaining it throughout the whole day, their stamina can skyrocket. She asks them to give it an initial try, only for the two to suddenly collapse in physical exhaustion, with Zenitsu yelling at its seeming impossibility. They ask Tanjiro and he states he can only maintain it by pushing himself; he describes the process of strengthening his lungs but his simple words and use of sounds only confuses the two. Shinobu motivating Zenitsu Shinobu appears behind him and claims the skill is basic, or even a beginner’s skill, asking why they are unable to do it, though she adds that mastering it takes great effort. Addressing them one after another, she motivates them in their own unique way: she playfully mocks Inosuke for being unable to do Total Concentration and claims he can’t be helped being unable to do something simple, enraging him and giving him the push just to prove her wrong. She then gets close to Zenitsu, holds his hand, and encourages him by being his “biggest cheerleader”, causing Zenitsu to become overjoyed at being touched by a pretty young woman. Outside, Zenitsu and Inosuke are doing the exercises Tanjiro had been using; sprinting along the fence to build stamina and lifting rocks to gain strength. Kanao watches them from the side and is approached by her master. Shinobu encourages her to train with them; Kanao instead bows to her and walks away. At a well on the other side of the mansion, she watches Tanjiro and Inosuke pushing Zenitsu to lift his weights harder. She takes a coin out of her pocket and flips it. Kanao catches it, sees its flipped side, and reminisces on her past. Kanao psychologically broken by abuse. She was originally a nameless girl from a poverty-stricken household alongside a river. Her parents were incredibly abusive and she had several siblings who also suffered alongside her. Her entire life then was only pain, hunger, and hopelessness. One day, she broke psychologically and she stopped feeling pain and emotions. She was sold into slavery by her parents but was too apathetic to think. Her owner was suddenly met by two girls; Shinobu and her elder sister Kanae. Kanae asks the man why she is tied up, to which he responds it is to prevent her from escaping. Kanae and Shinobu Kocho She approaches the little girl, introduces herself, and asks for her name, but Kanao only stares blankly at Kanae, shocking her. The man attempts to brush away Kanae’s attempts to talk to her but his hand is hit away by Shinobu, who demands he does not touch her. He becomes irritated and asks for payment if they want to talk to her; in response, Shinobu replies they will purchase her and throws money into the air. As he is distracted, she takes Kanao’s rope and the sisters run away. Kanae is unsure about their brazen theft but Shinobu claims it is fine; while they flee, Kanao has a glimmer in her eyes. At the Butterfly Mansion, Shinobu cleans up Kanao and clothes her. It is only then that the two learn just how emotionally broken she really is. Shinobu relays her frustration at the girl’s inability to make choices; commenting that even if she starves, she doesn’t eat until told to do so. Kanae instead tells her not to act so angrily since she enjoys looking at her smile, to her sister’s chagrin. Shinobu states it is dangerous to have a child who can’t think for even herself; to help this, Kanae gives Kanao a coin to help her decide. Kanae's way of helping Kanao. Shinobu is irate at a seemingly nonsensical solution and Kanae only replies the reason she is doing it is because Kanao is ""so adorable"", annoying her sister even more so. Nonetheless, she states that given a chance, a person’s soul will eventually open up, telling Kanao that if she ever falls in love, she can change too. Kanao stares at her coin and continues to watch the trio training, looking at Tanjiro. In the end, she decides not to be with them and walks away to let them continue training. Haganezuka enraged at Tanjiro Soon, Tanjiro receives a message from his Kasugai Crow; he finds Inosuke and announces that their new swords have arrived. He senses Haganezuka's scent and runs outside the mansion to greet him, seeing he is accompanied by another person. Unfortunately, the swordsmith is less than happy to see him and attempts to stab Tanjiro for snapping his blade. He tries to defend himself by mentioning he was close to dying and that the demon who did so was incredibly powerful, but Haganezuka only smacks his face and pins all the blame on the young Demon Slayer, claiming his weakness is why it broke. He continues to chase him in the mansion’s yard; Shinobu wonders if it is a new training regimen and Aoi responds it is likely not. Kanamori enraged at Inosuke chipping his blades. Inside, Tanjiro is told by the second smith that Haganezuka is very passionate about his creations; Tanjiro agrees while worriedly looking at Haganezuka staring at him in anger. The man introduces himself as Kanamori and states he is the smith who forges Inosuke’s swords. They watch as the new blades turn blue, to Kanamori’s admiration at the color. Tanjiro tells Inosuke he is glad to see him with new blades but they see him walk outside onto the yard. Kanamori asks him what he is doing and he, Tanjiro and Haganezuka watch as Inosuke picks up a stone and chips gouges into the edge. Kanamori becomes enraged at the sight of his work being destroyed and threatens to kill him. Inosuke is satisfied at the chips in the edge, angering his smith, and he proceeds to chip his second blade in the same way, infuriating Kanamori even more. Outside, Kanamori and Haganezuka leave the mansion, with the former yelling about the audacity of his client to break his swords with a stone, as Tanjiro incessantly apologizes on his and Inosuke’s behalf. That night, Tanjiro sleeps while being able to maintain Total Concentration; the three girls commend his success and they decide to treat him to rice balls when he awakens. Now adept at Total Concentration, Constant, Tanjiro face Kanao in the full-body training exercise once more; he is able to chase her throughout the match without slowing down, claiming he can’t wait to swing his sword. He is able to grab her hand and win the match. Next, they face off in the reflexes test, with both Demon Slayers seemingly neck and neck. Eventually, he grabs a cup of water and avoids Kanao’s attempt to stop him. But as he is about to splash her, he rationalizes that it would be cruel to splash Kanao with the unpleasant-smelling liquid. Tanjiro courteously defeats Kanao. Instead, Tanjiro puts the cup on her head, effectively achieving the same result. Sumi, Naho, and Kiyo see him succeed and they celebrate together. His victory is seen by Zenitsu and Inosuke, giving them the last motivation to push themselves. Outside, Zenitsu runs on the fences with new vigor and speed, while Inosuke lifts more weight than ever before. In a final medical exam in Shinobu’s office, she determines he is now fully healed and can take missions without any misgivings. Happy that his rehabilitation is complete, Tanjiro takes the time to ask Shinobu what she knows about Hinokami Kagura. To his surprise, she knows nothing about it. He tries to ask if she knows anything about “Fire Breathing”, getting the same response. After being told of what happened to him and how his father influenced him, Shinobu states perhaps his father had used Fire Breathing, which is different from the more familiar Flame Breathing, though she notes it is important not to misname each Breathing Style with the other. She states he can perhaps ask the Flame Hashira, though he is away on a mission. He thanks her for the help and makes his way out, but before Tanjiro can exit, Shinobu tells him that she expects great things from him. That night, in Nezuko’s room, he sees she is still asleep, having been so for the entire day. He sits down on her bed and confides in her about his unease in seeing her asleep for long periods, despite knowing she is simply regaining stamina. He tells her he will be going soon on his next mission now that he has healed and mastered Total Concentration Constant. He mentions how having both Zenitsu and Inosuke give him confidence, believing that Nezuko thinks that both of them are good as well. He remembers his goal to bring down the strongest demons and give its blood samples to Tamayo. As he becomes unsure if he can succeed in his goal, Nezuko unexpectedly encourages him: “I know you can do it, Big Brother”. He looks back and sees she is still asleep; regardless, the sudden message is enough to give him hope, thanking his sister. Meanwhile, on a moving train, a woman is killed and devoured by a giant, three-eyed demon on board.

26,New Mission,"As Tanjiro and the others are devoted to their rehabilitation training, the absolute master of the demons, Muzan Kibutsuji, gathers the lower ranks of the Twelve Kizuki. The demons, too, are preparing to make their next move. As training draws to a close, Tanjiro has improved to the point where he can fight on equal terms with Kanao. Just then, he receives word of a new mission from his Kasugai Crow.[1]","Tanjiro and Kanao face each other again at the reflexes test, with the match now very close; Zenitsu and Inosuke noting their incredible speed. She edges out a win by grabbing her cup before Tanjiro can block it. Aoi calls the test finished; Tanjiro compliments Kanao for her speed and Aoi states he now has tens wins and ten losses. Despite this, he claims he is not done; he asks his friends if they can run with him while maintaining Total Concentration, to Zenitsu's reluctance and Inosuke's excitement. Lower Six sees only the Lower Ranks are summoned. A few months ago, in a distorted space containing numerous rooms, Lower Six is summoned by the strum of a biwa. As he wonders where he is, Lower One and Two appear in the space with him. Lower Six wonders if being summoned is the Blood Demon Art of the demon woman in the center of the space, a seemingly infinitely large fortress. He sees that both Lower Three and Four are present as well, realizing that only the Lower Ranks have been summoned, which has never happened before; he then notes that Lower Five isn’t here. Muzan masking his appearance. At the strum of the Biwa Demon, the Lower Ranks are placed on the floor before her and another female demon. As Lower Six wonders who she is, the woman commands them to bow down and kneel in a familiar threatening voice. Instantly, the demons bow down before her, with Lower Six suddenly realizing that the woman is Muzan Kibutsuji, who had masked his appearance and aura. Lower Four apologizes on the demons’ behalf for mistaking him but Muzan orders her to silence herself, asking why is she speaking without permission and not to presume her “worthless thoughts"". He states they are only here to answer him and nothing else. Muzan tells them about the demise of Lower Five, Rui, and demands to know why the Lower Ranks are so weak. He says that being a Twelve Kizuki shouldn’t be enough for them as it is only the beginning of becoming more powerful, and the starting point where they can be useful to him. For over a century, the Upper Ranks have not changed and only they have been successful at killing Hashiras, yet the Lower Ranks continue to change and get replaced very frequently. Lower Six about to be eaten alive by Muzan. Lower Six sarcastically thinks to himself about how it seems easy for Muzan to talk about, only for Muzan to say the same words aloud: “That’s easy for you to say, but we-”, telling him to continue. Realizing he is caught, Muzan reminds him his thoughts aren't safe. He demands the demon speak his mind and when Lower Six doesn’t respond, the enraged Muzan grabs the terrified demon with an enlarged monstrous arm and hoists him up high. Lower Six cries and begs for forgiveness, only for his master to gruesomely devour him alive, shocking the Lower Ranks. Lower Three asks why this is happening, wondering if he will be killed too despite everything he did to become a Twelve Kizuki. Muzan asks if they is more afraid of the Demon Slayers than him. Lower Four denies this but Muzan claims all which she think about when facing them is escape. She states she would fight with her life at risk for him, but he sees her pleading only as refuting what he has just said. With his monstrous arm, Muzan kills Lower Four by crushing her body and absorbing her flesh. Lower Three beheaded by Muzan. Knowing he will be killed despite what he says and that it will be unlikely to battle him and win, Lower Three sees that Muzan is distracted and attempts to flee. With incredible speed, he races around the fortress and tries to find an escape route; Lower One sees this and denounces his actions as foolish. Lower Three manages to gain a considerable distance, only to be suddenly decapitated by Muzan, who states that it would be better if the Twelve Kizuki consists of only the Upper Ranks, hence why he is killing them. Lower Three’s severed head is unable to comprehend how he was beheaded since he didn’t hear the biwa’s strum. Muzan throws his head in front of the last two demons and asks if they have last words. Lower Two claims he can be of use to him and begs for a reprieve. Muzan asks how long of a reprieve is he requesting, how he intends to be useful, and what he can accomplish with his current level of skill. Lower Two asks for a portion of his blood and states he can successfully acclimate and fight as a more powerful demon. Muzan sees this request as an order and asks how he can instruct him to give his blood, denouncing him as shameless. ""You tried to tell me what to do. You deserve to die"" Frightened, Lower Two states he misunderstands his ambitions, only for Muzan to say he misunderstands nothing: “I’m the one who calls the shots. My word is absolute”. He tells Lower Two he has no right to reject what he says and that he alone is always right, telling him he deserves to die for telling him what to do. The last Lower Rank. As Lower Two’s blood spills off the floor, Muzan asks the last demon for his last words. Lower Three sees the interaction in his last moments and believes he too will die, as their lives hinge on Muzan’s mood. Lower One states that his current situation is like a dream for him, happy to die by Muzan's hands. He adds that he enjoyed the dead Lower Ranks’ last gasps, saying he feels blessed from hearing their despair and thanking him for leaving himself as the last to die. As Muzan stares at him, Lower One is suddenly pierced by a giant spine from his master’s arm. The demon is injected with a large amount of blood, before convulsing on the floor in agony. Satisfied, Muzan responds to his answer, “That’s what I like to hear”, telling Lower One he is given an ample share of blood, saying that while he may not withstand it and die, he will undoubtedly become more powerful should he survive. He tells him to make himself useful by killing the Hashira, adding that he can acquire more blood should he kill the Demon Slayer wearing hanafuda-earrings. The fortress shifts at the will of the Biwa Demon. With the strums of the Biwa Demon, the fortress space shifts, transporting Muzan to the surface and manipulating numerous doors to drop Lower One in an unknown town. The demon suddenly sees something as Muzan’s blood continues to change him; a vision of Tanjiro, and he surmises he can attain more blood by killing the Hashira and him. In the early morning, the trio are awoken by Tanjiro’s Kasugai Crow giving them information about their new mission. The casualties of the Mugen train are increasing, with 40 now missing; they must join Kyojuro Rengoku on-site and travel west. At noon, Kagaya Ubuyashiki speaks to Shinobu about his decision to send Tanjiro and his companions to the Mugen train mission, which he was recommended to do so by her. When asked why she thinks so, Shinobu states it is because of his pure soul and ability to strive hard on a daily basis, adding that he managed to exceed her expectations. Above all, he has one clear goal; to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji. Kagaya concurs with her thinking and logic. Shinobu also mentions that his father had used a “Fire Breathing” style, surprising Kagaya; and though he still has much ahead of him, Tanjiro could possibly be guided by Kyojuro. Kagaya comments on Tanjiro's sister becoming a demon and his encounters with Muzan, believing it may very well be his destiny to defeat him. Tanjiro remembers the survivor from Final Selection. Inside the mansion, Tanjiro is preparing to depart for his mission when he hears someone approaching him in the hallways. A tall young man walks his way and Tanjiro moves to the side to avoid bumping him; nevertheless, the stranger goes out of his way to shove into Tanjiro's shoulder. Initially dismayed the young man purposely hurt him, he suddenly recognizes him as the quarrelsome survivor of Final Selection, though he is shocked to see him so muscular in such a short time period. Tanjiro calls out to him but the young man ignores him and walks away. Outside, Aoi is told by Tanjiro about his upcoming mission. She states that while it wasn’t for long that they were together, she is glad to have spent that time with him and bids him good luck. He thanks her for looking out for them while being busy and that through her, they can go back out to battle once again. Aoi brushes aside his gratitude, claiming it was because of luck that she survived Final Selection and ended up too afraid to go into battle. As she laments her inability to fight, Tanjiro tells Aoi it doesn’t matter; since she helped him, she is now part of him and he can take her emotions to the battlefield, surprising her. Tanjiro leaves her by asking she look after him should he be injured again, as Aoi stands still, awestruck by his sincerity and kindness. Kanao speaks with Tanjiro. Tanjiro finds Kanao sitting by herself and thanks her for helping in his rehabilitation. She initially doesn’t say anything, confusing him. She then takes her coin, flips it, sees its side, and says, “All I did was follow the Master’s orders”. She claims he has no need to thank her and bids him farewell. Tanjiro is surprised to see Kanao speaking to him; he asks about the object she just flipped and why, as Kanao continues to say farewell. She states the coin is to help her make decisions she can’t make on her own, pointing out that she didn’t want to talk to him but the coin’s result made her. Tanjiro asks why she didn’t decide on her own accord and she states it doesn’t matter; nothing matters to her so she can’t decide. He responds that there can’t be a thing that doesn’t matter. He concludes that the voice in her heart is “really small”. He suddenly has an idea and asks Kanao for her coin; though reluctant, she hands it over to him nonetheless. Out in the yard, he tells Kanao of his intentions; he will flip to decide if she should listen to the voice in her heart from now on. He flicks it but the coin goes too high, making him lose sight of it. He decides that landing “Heads” will make her listen; Kanao appears somewhat concerned throughout the entire situation. Eventually, the coin lands, and Tanjiro catches it, bringing it over so that they can both see the result; Kanao is anxious since she couldn’t see the moment the coin landed. Tanjiro tells Kanao to listen to her heart. Upon revealing the result and seeing it has landed “heads”, Tanjiro is overjoyed whilst she is surprised. He gives the coin back; when she stretches her hand to take it, he suddenly puts it in her palm while holding her hand, shocking her. Tanjiro bids her good luck and says it is the heart that drives people. And now made to listen, her's can grow “as strong as you want it to”. He bids her goodbye and walks away, only for Kanao to ask how he made it land on “heads”. She is unsure to feel about the result but knew she saw his hand and that he didn’t cheat. Kanao thinks about Tanjiro's message. He only tells her it was by chance, and that had it landed “tails”, he would have continued to flip it to get the right result. Tanjiro smiles brightly at Kanao and leaves. Visibly struck by his bright personality, she holds the coin close to her. In from of Kiyo, Sumi, and Naho, the trio attempt to break the largest gourd in a final test. Cheered on by the girls, they all successfully break them, signifying their mastery of Total Concentration, Constant. As the girls see them off, Tanjiro suddenly sees Giyu Tomioka in the distance, calling out to him. Giyu sees they are about to embark on a mission and he commends them for mastering Total Concentration, Constant. Tanjiro thanks him for his dedication to helping Nezuko, unaware he was putting his life on the line for her. Unsure of how to thank him, Giyu tells him he can do so by killing demons. Tanjiro suddenly hears the girls crying as they are about to leave, telling them to take care. Zenitsu tears up while Inosuke is giddy over holding the food. Kiyo tells Zenitsu to learn to respect and be considerate to girls, shocking him with her blunt request. He asks whether they feel sad that he is leaving, to which the girls say they don’t, disappointing him. With this, Tanjiro takes the lead and the trio leaves for their mission. Inosuke seeing a train for the first time. At a train station, they see the location of their mission; the Mugen train. Inosuke is in awe at the sight of the “creature”, believing it is the “master of this land”. Zenitsu corrects him and states it is simply a train. Inosuke decides to lead the charge and prepares to draw his blades but Tanjiro stops him, only to erroneously think the train is in fact the “guardian spirit of the land” and that he shouldn’t attack it. An annoyed Zenitsu tells him it is a train to transport people, calling him a “country bumpkin”. In front of all, Inosuke head butts the train’s carriage to attack it, causing police to arrive at the scene. They see the trio have swords and attempt to arrest them. After evading the authorities, Zenitsu explains that the Demon Slayer Corps isn’t recognized by the Japanese Government, hence why they can’t have their weapons exposed in public. Tanjiro is dismayed to learn all their work goes unknown, to which Zenitsu agrees as well. They decide to hide the swords in their back, which does not work on the shirtless Inosuke. Lower One on the Mugen train. At that moment, the train begins to move, forcing the trio to chase it and climb aboard; Zenitsu lags behind, forcing his friends to help him get on. As Inosuke becomes amazed at the train’s speed, Zenitsu asks Tanjiro whether it was wise to take Nezuko with him, believing the Corps’ Headquarters is the safest place. He reassures him of Nezuko's safety, “Wherever we go, Nezuko and I will be together. We’re never going to be apart again”, before reminiscing on the long journey they had taken together to reach this point. Onboard the train with them are the Flame Hashira and Lower Rank One of the Twelve Kizuki.

27,Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku,"Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku receives new orders: Travel to the Mugen Train, where over forty people have gone missing, and conduct an investigation.","Leaving the Demon Slayer Corps Headquarters, he sets off on this new mission.[1] In the dead of night, a conductor walks around the carriage of a moving train. As he ensures it is empty, the lights flicker; he turns and sees a marked demon hiding in the shadows. As he attempts to flee, he is rapidly killed and his body is discovered later. Kyojuro at an udon shop. A Demon Slayer enters a soba shop, guided by a Kasugai Crow. He enters and sees the Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku, enjoying a bowl. Apologizing for interrupting his meal, Kyojuro offers a seat and asks the chef to give him a bowl as well. The two discuss an incident last night, where they discovered an injured woman, attacked by a demon but now recovering in hospital. Kyojuro asks the chef on how business is, to which the chef responds everybody is afraid to be outside after dark, with word of a slasher going around, even forcing him to let off his workers. He adds the news of the Mugen Train being put out of service, after 40 of its passengers had mysteriously disappeared. The Demon Slayer informs the Hashira the Mugen train has been located and they leave to investigate. Fuku and her grandmother. In a train station, a young girl, Fuku, struggles to feel better after no one buys her bento boxes, due to the place being completely empty. Her grandmother tries to cheer her up by claiming she can sell instead during the afternoon, as demons only roam around at night. The Demon Slayer and Kyojuro search around the station but find nothing unusual. Instead, they witness Fuku irritably dissuade her grandmother's advice about demons, claiming they don't exist. Kyojuro approaches her and bluntly claims he is looking for a demon, to the shock of the accompanying Demon Slayer. Fuku angrily claims there is no demon, hurling her bean bun at Kyojuro and smacking him in the face. She soon apologizes and states she feels so on edge with the news of the Slasher affecting everyone. Kyojuro advises them to continue business and claims he will deal with the Slasher. Fuku tries to sell him some bento boxes, to which he excitedly decide to buy them all. He gives them to the Demon Slayer, telling him to return to the headquarters and claiming they will make great gifts for the Demon Slayer Corps. Kyojuro finds his mission. Kyojuro boards a train with a crate of bentos and is happened upon by an annoyed conductor. He claims to be a bento vendor and is looking for the Mugen train's shed, believing the train he is on will take him there. The conductor corrects him by stating the Mugen train's maintenance facility is in fact a fair way in the distance. The Flame Hashira thanks him and states this is now where he will disembark, before leaping off the train and running towards the facility. He enters and sees the train being repaired, before sensing the faint scent of a demon lingering on it. A worker asks why he is trespassing onto the facility, to which Kyojuro states he was sent to give food to the workers. As he passes the boxes around and the workers eat, Kyojuro asks why the Mugen Train is here, where he is told the train is claimed to be a ""man-eating train"". However, the worker informs him the train is actually slated to be put back in service after the repairs are made, worrying him. Suddenly, someone screams, forcing Kyojuro into action as he investigates what has happened. He sees the marked demon, holding a young boy, Tatsu, in his hands and driving his claws in. The workers follow and are horrified seeing the demon clutching their friend. The demon wretches, before stomping on a dropped bento box and claiming human food is repulsive to him. As the Hashira confront him for stepping on it, the demon digs into the boy's flesh deeper and responds that he only devours humans that ""seem tasty"" and harms those who he find disgusting. Suddenly, his markings glow, and he speeds around Kyojuro and tries to goad him into attacking. The scene forces the other workers to flee in terror while Kyojuro stands his ground. The Slasher runs away to finds Fuku and her grandmother. The demon claims he is the fastest and taunts him, claiming he can't kill him without injuring the boy. He also mentions that last night, he had slashed a woman till he became bored, making Kyojuro realize it was he who had injured the woman he had found. He commends the demon for his speed but warns him to be get cocky, adding the woman was in fact saved and is determined to heal without lasting wounds. Instead, the demon decide he will now kill the vendors who gave him the bento boxes in place of the woman. Before then, he decides to kill the young boy, but Kyojuro rushes forward and slices off both his hands, saving him. The demon retreats and stands outside the shed, before smelling the likely station the vendors are at and speeding forward to kill them. Kyojuro uses Total Concentration to reach incredible speeds. Kyojuro treats the boy's wounds before calming the concerned workers by stating his friends will arrive, to which more Demon Slayers arrive to assist him. Meanwhile, Fuku and her grandmother have arrived at the station and Fuku is begins setting up shop. The demon arrives shortly after and smells them nearby. Kyojuro leaves the rest to them and follows the train tracks, using Total Concentration Breathing to accelerate him to incredible speeds, determined to stop the demon and save them. The demon finds Fuku and moves forward to kill her, but is hit by a bento box thrown by her grandmother. With the demon momentarily disgusted by the smell, Fuku attempts to flee outside but is quickly caught, the demon viciously grabbing the young girl's throat. Before he can kill her, Kyojuro arrives and slices the demon's Achilles, saving Fuku. Stunned by what she had just witnessed, she realizes her grandmother is now alone. The demon confronts her for throwing the bento box but is instead accosted by Kyojuro. Wondering how he had caught up to him so quickly, the Hashira repeats his words about not getting cocky. Kyojuro defeats Slasher with First Form: Unknowing Fire. The demon challenges him on who is faster; whether he can kill Fuku's grandmother first or Kyojuro decapitates him before. To this, Kyojuro claims he is slow and he instantly rushes forward, decapitating the demon with the Flame Breathing, First Form: Unknowing Fire. After decapitating the demon, Kyojuro performs a process of Chiburi, sliding the demon's blood off the blade of his Nichirin Sword, dragging the blunt-end of the kissaki toward the koiguchi of the scabbard and sheathing the sword through Nōtō. His actions suddenly reminds Fuku's grandmother about an incident 20 years ago; she herself was protected from a demon by the previous Flame Hashira. She was saved, along with her daughter, Fuku's mother, and is soon driven to tears after seeing Kyojuro's haori and witnessing him sheath his blade in the same way her previous saviour had. She tearfully mentions this to him, to which he responds that it was most likely his father who saved her. He is simply following in his footsteps to save people from demons. Fuku apologizes to her grandmother for not believing in demons, to which Kyojuro laughs and responds that not believing they exist is for the better. Other Demon Slayers arrive at the scene, to which Kyojuro informs them the demon has been dealt with. He adds that the Mugen Train is being repaired tonight and will back in service the next day. When his companion claims the situation is now over, the Hashira tells him the Mugen Train had 40 people go missing, and the demon likely responsible is not the one he had just killed. He believes the train is harboring a far more powerful demon. The sun rises to a new day and people now swarm the streets; the soba chef overhears news the Mugen Train is back in service, hoping nothing odd happens again. Inosuke head butts the Mugen train. As the sun sets, Kyojuro boards the Mugen Train for his investigation, but not before meeting Fuku and her grandmother again. They offer him beef bento boxes in gratitude for saving them; he happily takes them, as they are not the one he tried before. He takes her entire supply and they wish him good luck on his mission. As the train prepares for departure, Fuku sells some bento boxes to the passengers but hears a loud commotion nearby; Inosuke Hashibira head-butting the train and Zenitsu Agatsuma angrily accosting him. Inside the train, the passengers prepare for the trip; Kyojuro decide now is time to eat the bento box, to which he opens the package and tries his meal, before loudly exclaiming it to be delicious.

28,Deep Sleep,"Tanjiro's group, fresh from completing their training at the Butterfly Mansion, head to their next mission, the Mugen Train. There they rendezvous with Rengoku, who arrived ahead of them. Tanjiro is overwhelmed by the always-energetic Rengoku, Zenitsu is frightened by the prospect of facing demons as usual, and Inosuke is immensely excited by the sight of the huge machine. But on this train loaded with passengers, a new battle is about to begin.[1]","The trio find Kyojuro aboard. Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke all board the Mugen train for their mission to accompany the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku. Inosuke, having never been inside a train, is ecstatic, continually interrupting the passengers in his amazement, to Zenitsu's ever growing annoyance. As they enter another car and wonder about the Hashira's potential character, they hear someone continually yelling ""Delicious!"". The three realize it is Kyojuro himself, happily enjoying bento boxes. While he ignores them while eating, when he finishes, Tanjiro formally introduces his comrades to him. Kyojuro also deduces that Nezuko is in the box on Tanjiro's back. As Zenitsu attempts to control Inosuke's antics, Kyojuros asks Tanjiro on why they are on the train, to which he responds they received word from a Kasugai Crow to accompany him. Tanjiro, directed by Shinobu, also takes time to ask Kyojuro on his knowledge of his father's breathing technique, Hinokami Kagura. To this, Kyojuro bluntly states he has no knowledge about it; he commends Tanjiro's father for his skill in battle and doesn't continue. When Tanjiro pries for more information, Kyojuro instead declares he should be his Tsuguko. Kyojuro explains the branches of Breathing Styles. But to Tanjiro's question, he adds that given Flame Breathing's long history, there was always a Flame Hashira and a Water Hashira together within the Demon Slayer Corps. Kyojuro explains the five fundamental breathing forms; Flame, Water, Wind, Stone and Thunder. Other forms were derived from them as a result. Kyojuro ask for Tanjiro's sword color and he states that he has never heard of a Hashira with a black blade. Kyojuro again exuberantly asks Tanjiro to train with him and claims he can now rest with his question answered, but he quietly declines. As the Hashira rests, Tanjiro, while noting Kyojuro seems strange, senses he is caring and possess a strong sense of justice. When Inosuke sticks his body out a window to marvel at the train's speed, Zenitsu angrily tries to pull him back. Kyojuro tells Inosuke to stop, as a demon may be near by. Zenitsu freaks out at his words as he thought they were travelling to the demon, not be in its presence. Kyojuro mentions that forty people have disappeared on board and Demon Slayers sent to solve the issue haven't responded back either, hence why a Hashira like him was deployed. Zenitsu goes into shock in fear, just as a train conductor enters the car to punch their tickets. The four each present their tickets but the carriage light flickers, followed by a bad scent detected by Tanjiro. The conductor thanks them but his strange demeanor alerts Kyojuro into getting up and revealing his blade, advising the man to overlook his sword as it is now an emergency. As the lights begin to flicker again, a massive demon emerges from plain view, frightening the passengers and startling the Demon Slayers. Kyojuro wonders if its Blood Demon Art had hidden its body. He threatens the demon and unsheathes his blade, voicing sloud that he will burn it to the bone should it attack the innocent. Kyojuro uses First Form: Unknowing Fire. The demon roars in response and charges, to which Kyojuro retaliates by using his Flame Breathing, First Form: Unknowing Fire, speeding forward and decapitating it instantly. The trio are amazed at his feat but Kyojuro adds there is another demon on board. He moves on ahead, making Tanjiro and Inosuke follow him while Zenitsu, still afraid, timidly asks not to leave him behind. The lights flicker again but the conductor and passengers, having ran to the other side to avoid the demon, vanish. Kyojuro kills the second demon with Second Form: Rising Scorching Sun. In the next car, the passengers flee while Kyojuro observes his opponent. When the demon attempts to attack a lone passenger, he warns it that he will be its opponent. Inosuke tries to attack head-on, ignoring Tanjiro's advice to save the passenger first. Inosuke believes he can do both at the same time but the demon extends its arms to grab him. Suddenly, Kyojuro rushes in and saves Inosuke, turns back to save the passenger and advises him to exit the car to safety. Now with no passengers left, the Flame Hashira unleashes Flame Breathing, Second Form: Rising Scorching Sun, killing the demon in one swing. An amazed Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke all cheerfully asks to be Kyojuro's Tsuguko, to which he happily accepts them all. Later through the night, all the passengers are soundly asleep. The conductor from earlier rushes into an empty car and begins begging on the floor, adding he had done what he was told. He begins to cry and begs to be reunited with his dead family. A disembodied hand appears and commends him for his good work, before calmly whispering ""Go to sleep"", causing the conductor to suddenly fall asleep. The hand is then met by four children asking for what to do; the hand mentions to let their slumber grow deeper, since perceptive Demon Slayers can still sense demons and awaken, adding that when they do tie the rope to not touch them. Tanjiro apologizes to Hanako and Shigeru. Tanjiro begins to walk slowly through deep snow and suddenly finds himself in a snowy forest. Unaware of what is happening, he tries to calm himself and looks about for danger. Suddenly, he sees Shigeru and Hanako, who welcome him home and asks about how much coal he had sold. Seeing his lost siblings once more, he drops his blade and sprints to them, knocking them down. Tanjiro pulls them into a tight hug and breaks down in tears while incessantly apologizing, much to their shock. In reality, Tanjiro is still soundly asleep on the train. Enmu, Lower Rank One of the Twelve Kizuki. Outside, on top of the locomotive, Lower Rank One Enmu comments they are lucky to die whilst dreaming. To him, no matter how powerful a Demon Slayer is, they are humans fundamentally, driven by their heart, their spirit, like all others. He can simply destroy their spiritual core to kill them, humans cores are fragile and weak. The children who earlier spoke with Enmu, begin tying a rope around the wrist of all four Demon Slayers to their own, then they each count to ten while closing their eyes. Tanjiro is finally reunited with his family. Hanako tells them of the moment Tanjiro had suddenly teared up upon hugging them, to which Takeo jokingly calls him a weirdo. His mother Kie comments he must be exhausted, to which Tanjiro responds he is fine. Kie wonders if he may have a fever and advises him to take some rest. Shigeru runs to his eldest brother and happily puts a blanket over him in response to his mother's advice, making Rokuta laugh and Hanako to become slightly annoyed. Tanjiro is ""reunited"" with his family. Tanjiro is unbothered, glad to be back home and commenting he may just have been having a bad dream. Enmu mutters that when humans keep falling deeper into the dream, they eventually stop breathing, And even if a demon attacks them now, they won't sense it. Enmu, sensing Tanjiro is falling deeper and deeper into his dream, whispers to him, ""You are falling... you are falling... into a dream. It's a deep slumber... they can... no longer awaken.""

He speaks of how humans are all the same: Demon Slayers or not, they are led by their heart, their spiritual core. Once it is destroyed, they are trapped in a sleep they can never awaken from again. He senses that Tanjiro continues to fall deeper into his slumber as he dreams he is reunited with his family.","Zenitsu's dream with Nezuko As Zenitsu falls deeper into his sleep, he dreams he is in a peach tree forest, with Nezuko as his girlfriend. He carries her on his back when she claims she cannot swim a river and they traverse the mountains with his Thunder Breathing. Inosuke dreams he is leading a cave expedition, accompanied by Nezuko, ""Ponjiro"" and ""Chuitsu"" as his underlings. They encounter the beast that is the Mugen train in the cave and proceed to charge ahead to attack it. Kyojuro and his father. Kyojuro dreams he is at the Rengoku Estate, sitting before his father to tell him of his promotion into a Hashira. However, he dismisses his achievement and calls it worthless, adding that he believes Kyojuro would never amount to anything, as does he. Kyojuro walks out and sees his brother Senjuro, who asks about their father's answer, believing maybe he could be acknowledged as well if he becomes a Hashira. Kyojuro remarks that his father had never acted as such in the past; he once held the mantle of Flame Hashira but unexpectedly quit, and he too was once enthusiastic about training him. Though he is dismayed, he refuses to dwell on it and instead encourages Senjuro that despite their father's lack of acknowledgement, he will continue to be proud and passionate. Senjuro tears up when his brother mentions he as him as moral support. An unconscious Kyojuro attack Enmu's proxy The four children tasked by Enmu manage to enter their dreams, enabled by a rope made of his Blood Demon Art. Enmu explains the dream world contains a border to the realm of the subconscious, and they can pass it once they enter the dream and locate its edge, instructing them to destroy their spiritual cores to cripple them. The girl tasked with Kyojuro finds the edge and crosses the border with an awl made with Enmu's bone. As she traverses the unusually hot and fiery realm of subconsciousness, she manages to locate his spiritual core. When she moves in to destroy it, Kyojuro suddenly grabs her throat whilst both are still unconscious, causing the girl in the realm to be crippled and unable to move; she becomes stunned and amazed at his incredible survival instincts despite being fully asleep. Tanjiro plays with Rokuta while his mother Kie decides to make them rice crackers as a treat. Takeo becomes annoyed and too wants rice crackers, causing Hanako and Shigeru to add that they themselves want some as well. Meanwhile, the boy tasked with Tanjiro has entered the dream and overhears the Kamado family. Outside, Tanjiro chops down wood for a fire, but when he fills the basket and begins walking home, he mutters, ""Nezuko, let's go"". Suddenly confused at his words, he looks back at his basket. He returns home and enters the living room, before looking around and asking on Nezuko's whereabouts. Takeo answers she went out to pick vegetables, causing him to grow worried since it's day. His concern confuses his siblings, but before he can explain, Kie asks him to fetch water for a bath. Tanjiro urges himself to wake up As he walks to the river, he tries to make sense of his unusual remarks; while doing so, he unexpectedly sees Nezuko's box in the corner of his eye but it vanishes when he takes a closer look. Dismissing it as simply a tool box, he reaches the river and fills his buckets. Suddenly, he sees his reflection warning him to wake up; it pulls him into the water and claims he is under attack, causing Tanjiro to realize he truly is still on the train and asleep. The reflection begs him to wake up and fight, causing him to return to his home. In the living room, Tanjiro is now fully aware he is in a dream but is unable to see a way to escape. On the train, Nezuko falls out her box and sees Tanjiro and the Demon Slayers all unconscious. She sees Tanjiro whispering that he needs to wake up and tries numerous ways to do so, before she grows frustrated and head-butts her brother to awaken him. Failing to do so and bleeding from the impact, she begins to cry and tries again, causing her Blood Demon Art to activate. In the dream, Tanjiro becomes engulfed in Nezuko's flames, to the confusion and worry of his siblings. He smells her blood and becomes covered in more fire, regaining his Demon Slayer uniform and Nichirin sword, realizing he is slowly waking up. Takeo and Hanako ask if he is alright; Tanjiro answers that he needs to leave and apologizes. Tanjiro hears Nezuko once more Running out the house, he sprints into the woods, believing he needs to find a demon within the forest. To his shock, he hears Nezuko asking where he is going, having returned with a platter of vegetables. Hearing her voice again, he begins to tear up, while his family arrives to question him. Kie asks if he is all right but he doesn't answer, to his siblings' concern. Instead, he wishes he could stay here, as his voice begins to break; he wishes he could go back and by all rights, he is meant to do so, returning to his life of making charcoal and looking after his family. If it never happened, they would all still be alive and Nezuko still human. Tanjiro accepts the reality Instead, he walks on ahead to leave them, accepting their deaths and that he could never be with them again. Seeing his oldest brother leaving, Rokuta cries out to him and tries to chase him, causing Tanjiro to cry and apologize that they can never be together again. He runs out further, whispering they will always be in his heart no matter what. Meanwhile, the boy who entered his dream crosses into his realm of subconsciousness but finds it unusually calm and peaceful. Outside the train, Enmu becomes confused that the children seem to be taking a while, since none of the spiritual cores have been destroyed yet, but doesn't dwell on it. Tanjiro realizes he is trapped in the dream but senses the scent of a demon in the air. Wondering how he will save everyone he is suddenly met by his father, Tanjuro, who appears for a moment and tells him to take up his blade, as there is something he needs to cut. He unsheathes his sword and realizes what he must do to wake up and escape the dream.

30,Insult,"Tanjiro realizes he's in a dream and figures out that in order to wake up, he must cut his own neck. Meanwhile, Enmu’s accomplices have entered the unconscious realms of Tanjiro’s group to destroy their spirit cores but are growing impatient at their own failures.[1]","As Tanjiro positions his Nichirin sword at his neck, the boy in his realm of subconsciousness becomes guided by figments of his spirits. They lead him to the spiritual core but he becomes unwilling to destroy it. Tanjiro pushes the blade in and the realm of subconsciousness opens as he begins to awaken from his dream; the boy falls into the abyss but Tanjiro's spirit saves him. Inosuke attacks his intruder The girl tasked with Inosuke's dream becomes lost in his realm of subconsciousness, a dim and creepy cave; she is subsequently chased by an animalistic Inosuke. The boy tasked with Zenitsu is stuck in his realm of subconsciousness, a pitch black emptiness he gets lost in. He hears the clap of metal getting closer and see an angry Zenitsu, menacingly wielding a pair of garden shears. Angered at the 'parasite' invading his dream, Zenitsu gives chase and shreds the boy's clothes. Tanjiro finally slashes his throat and wakes up. He realizes Nezuko is safe but sees his fellow Demon Slayers still asleep, as well as the children tied to their wrist. He notices his own wrist is tied to a burnt rope, giving off the scent of a demon. He remembers the punched ticket and smells it too, confirming they fell into a Blood Demon Art. Tanjiro tasks Nezuko with burning the ropes but he fails to awaken Zenitsu or Inosuke. Enmu's proxy thanks Tanjiro Suddenly, he is attacked by the girl tasked with Kyojuro's dream, trying to stab him with her awl. Angered at her chance at a dream ruined, she is joined by Zenitsu's and Inosuke's attempted killers; she notices the boy tasked with Tanjiro and urges him too, but he doesn't respond. Tanjiro knocks all his attackers unconscious but apologizes for denying them their dreams, as he sadly mentions that he wanted to stay in his too. The remaining boy meets him and explains how his soul had saved him, thanking him as he regrets his willingness to hurt him to escape his illness. Enmu meets Tanjiro Tanjiro walks outside and becomes repulsed at the strong demonic scent in the wind; he climbs up and confront Enmu. The demon is stunned at Tanjiro awakening from his dream, commenting he could have shown him one where his family dies or a dream where he meets his father still alive. Enmu remarks about his joy in witnessing the pained faces of someone experiencing a nightmare, as well as noting the more complex process he used for this specific Blood Demon Art; with the tickets punched containing his blood, his victims would fall asleep quickly and the act unnoticed, but he becomes perplexed at how Tanjiro had managed to wake up. Tanjiro battles Lower One Angered at Enmu tampering with his family memories, Tanjiro confronts him for intruding into his soul. Enmu sees his Hanafuda earrings and becomes overjoyed that his target came to him, happy he can now claim more of Muzan's blood. Tanjiro uses Water Breathing, Tenth Form: Constant Flux and charges forward; Enmu responds with Blood Demon Art: Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis and hits him, forcing him to lose consciousness. Tanjiro suddenly awakens and attacks, forcing Enmu to dodge his slashes and using his Blood Demon Art continuously, Tanjiro regains consciousness each time, making Enmu realize that Tanjiro is continually committing suicide to awaken each time. Tanjiro beheads Enmu with Tenth Form: Constant Flux Enmu forces Tanjiro into a dream once more, only to be a nightmare with his bloody family and resurrected father angered at him being the only survivor of the massacre. Instead of being afraid, Tanjiro becomes furious and declares they would never say that. He leaps into the air and decapitates Enmu with Constant Flux. Though he has successfully sliced Enmu's neck, Tanjiro becomes concerned that killing him was too simple. Enmu reveals he has fused with the Mugen train. His suspicions prove correct when Enmu's head grows flesh and adheres to the Mugen train's carriage. Lower One mocks him for believing he had succeeded, as he happily mentions that while Tanjiro and the other Demon Slayers slept, he had fused with the entire train. With the 200 passengers at his mercy, Enmu challenges Tanjiro to save them by himself from being devoured. Realizing he can only protect two cars at most, Tanjiro begs his comrades to wake up. At that moment, Nezuko succeeds in waking Inosuke, who bursts from the roof reinvigorated and declares himself ""Lord Inosuke"".

31,Move Forward!,"With Enmu’s body now fused with the Mugen Train, the over two hundred passengers have become hostages. As Enmu’s tentacles try to attack the passengers, Tanjiro recognizes the limits of his ability to protect everyone. In addition to a freshly-awakened Inosuke, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Rengoku join Tanjiro in an all-out fight to protect the lives of the passengers.[1]","Inosuke attacks Enmu with Fifth Form: Crazy Cutting. After failing to kill Enmu, Tanjiro is left to save the 200 passengers at his mercy. Inosuke awakens and joins the battle. Enmu's flesh begins to infest the Mugen train's carriages and tentacles form to kill the passengers. Inosuke springs to action and cuts them all with his Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang: Crazy Cutting. Outside, more ingrowths form and attack Tanjiro, forcing him to retreat inside and see the extent of Enmu's assimilation with the train. He tries to use the Water Breathing, First Form: Water Surface Slash to cut them down but the tentacles continue to grow. Enmu becomes pleased that Tanjiro is exerting himself to cut something he can always heal and hopes his depleted stamina will make them all easy prey. Zenitsu saves Nezuko from being overwhelmed. Nezuko grows in size and battles the tentacles to save the sleeping passengers. Using her claws and legs, she fends them off until the sheer number of them overwhelms and restrains her. Suddenly, Zenitsu appears and saves her, using his Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash, Sixfold and cutting all the tentacles in the carriage instantly. Tanjiro hears the attack and surmises Zenitsu has awaken, though he is still dealing with the regenerating tentacles. Kyojuro stalls Enmu's onslaught. Kyojuro, now awake, witnesses the demonic appearance of the train and grows ashamed as a Hashira, before attacking with intense force, startling Enmu. Tanjiro sees Kyojuro, who had slashed the train and damaged it enough to force Enmu to take time and heal. Kyojuro informs him of the plan; he himself will guard the five rear-most cars while Zenitsu and Nezuko will protect the front three, whereas he and Inosuke will look for the demon's head, telling him no matter what form he takes, Enmu's head is somewhere. With that, Kyojuro rushes out and goes to the back. Tanjiro praises him for his quick-thinking before telling Inosuke the plan. Inosuke informs him he already knows, adding his annoyance that Kyojuro had ordered him and considering him awesome still. He also tells Tanjiro the head is located near the front, prompting him to leap onto the roof and join him. Inosuke cuts away the locomotive's roof and lands; he sees a conductor but ignores him to look around for the head. Multiple tentacles sprout and grab him until Tanjiro appears and cuts them all with Water Breathing, Sixth Form: Whirlpool. Attacking nearing his head causes Enmu to shriek and shake the entire train. Inosuke slices the floor with Beast Breathing, Second Fang: Slice, revealing Enmu's neck bone. Tanjiro attempts to cut it with his Water Breathing, Eighth Form: Waterfall Basin but flesh grows, protecting it from the slash. It forms many new tentacles and spreads out, forcing Tanjiro to take the conductor and retreat to the second train car. The flesh grows rapidly and forms a ring around the front car while protecting the neck bone. Tanjiro tells Inosuke to coordinate their breathing together but eyes appear in front of them. Blood Demon Art: Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep Enmu's new Blood Demon Art, Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep, activates and hits them both, causing Tanjiro to slash his neck again in his dream. Though he awakens, the eyes open and hit him again. Cursing himself for falling under again, he kills himself again and leaps towards the neck bone. The eyes open again, forcing him to commit suicide again. Tanjiro continues to get hit and kill himself until he positions the blade near his neck despite the eyes being closed. Before he can kill himself for real, Inosuke stops him and tells Tanjiro not to die a lame death. Inosuke, unaffected due to his mask, starts slashing the eyes; Tanjiro realized the mask prevents Enmu from gauging his line of sight. The conductor suddenly appears, armed with a bone awl. Before he can stab Inosuke, Tanjiro jumps in and takes the blow to his stomach. He knocks the conductor unconscious but Inosuke angrily tells him to leave him to die. Tanjiro refuses to do so but more tentacles grab both of Inosuke's blades. Inosuke exposes the bone with Fourth Form: Slice 'n' Dice. Realizing they will not survive without decapitating the demon, they begin to move forward with the plan. Larger tentacles form and sprout many arms to grab the two Demon Slayers, though they dodge and slash them away. The tentacles slam down onto the train, forcing Tanjiro and Inosuke to leap into the air to safety. Working in tandem, the two slice the tentacles down to the bottom to slow their fall but the eyes appears once more. Tanjiro beheads Enmu with Hinokami Kagura: Clear Blue Sky. Before the Blood Demon Art can activate, Inosuke slashes them and leaps down to the neck bone, preventing Enmu for seeing his line of sight. Using his Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang: Slice 'n' Dice, he cuts away the surrounding flesh and exposes the bone. Tanjiro plummets down and prays that his father protect him, as his breathing begins to ignite in fire. Using the Hinokami Kagura: Clear Blue Sky, he successfully severs Enmu's neck bone, decapitating him. Enmu becomes terrified at his impending death and tries to grab the passengers with his arms to kill them. Kyojuro thwarts his attempt and cuts his flesh away with his Flame Breathing.

Sustaining injuries all over his body, Tanjiro is relieved to hear from Rengoku that all the passengers are safe. At that very moment, another demon appears before them...[1]","The train derailed from Enmu's shock. After Tanjiro successfully beheads Enmu, the demon's flesh falls off the cars but the Lower Rank's screams cause the Mugen train to derail at high speed. A sudden impact causes Tanjiro, Inosuke and the unconscious conductor to be flung into the air, Tanjiro desperately attempting to save him. The train flies off the tracks and skids down the ground, as Tanjiro himself rolls helplessly through the dirt. Inosuke safely lands on Enmu's soft flesh and runs to his comrade, asking for his wellbeing. Though he answers back, Tanjiro realises the wound to his stomach and from rolling across the ground will stop him from moving. Tanjiro asks if the conductor and passengers are safe, to which Inosuke responds the conductor is pinned by his legs under the cars. He refuses to help, still angered at him for stabbing Tanjiro and adding he will likely never walk again. Tanjiro begs him, telling his friend the man has already atoned for his sin, to which Inosuke eventually relents and goes to help him free. As he lies down to rest, believing Nezuko, Zenitsu and Kyojuro are safe, a small piece of Enmu's flesh crawls out the wreckage. Slowly disintegrating, he curses himself for being unable to eat even one of the 200 passengers, then pins the blame on the Flame Hashira, having thwarted his plan to devour them while fused with the train. He curses Zenitsu, who fought him while still asleep and becomes bewildered at a demon like Nezuko stopping him as well. He crawls towards the Demon Slayer who defeated him, while muttering it was Tanjiro in the first place who ruined his plan, as well as Inosuke and his excellent intuition. Lower Rank One falls. As his flesh begins to fade, he laments only the Lower Ranks get killed whilst the Upper Ranks stay alive for centuries. In his final moments, Enmu begs for another chance while being terrified at the nightmare that is his death, as Lower One finally falls. Tanjiro is suddenly met by Kyojuro, who commends him for mastering Total Concentration, Constant. He tells him Constant is the first of many steps to being a Hashira and advices him to increase his control and breathing precision. Kyojuro tells him a blood vessel in his abdomen is torn, assisting him in internally stopping the blood. The Hashira tells him he will be stronger than he was yesterday, then adds that none of the passengers are injured, to Tanjiro's relief. Upper Rank Three appears. Out of nowhere, a blast erupts from behind them. As Kyojuro and Tanjiro look behind, they watch as a figure emerges from the dust cloud. Tanjiro reads the kanji in the figure's eyes and becomes horrified he is staring at Upper Rank Three. The demon looks at Tanjiro and suddenly disappears, rushing forward to kill him. Kyojuro reads the attack and slashes the demon's arm with Flame Breathing, Second Form: Rising Scorching Sun. The demon flips back and heals the wound in moments, while complimenting his blade. Kyojuro asks why the demon would attack the injured first, to which he responds he was worried Tanjiro would get in the middle of their chat. Kyojuro retaliates by stating despite having just met , he already dislikes him. Upper Three states he is simply disgusted by the weak, then proposes he transform into a demon too, to which Kyojuro refuses. He asks for Kyojuro's name and then introduces himself as Akaza. Akaza uses Destructive Death: Compass Needle. He tries to goad him again, telling him as a demon, he could train and become stronger for centuries to come. Tanjiro notices the scent he emits is by far the strongest of Muzan he's faced thus far. Kyojuro tells Akaza that growing old and dying is part of being human, telling him strength is not just about the body. He retorts that Tanjiro isn't weak and refuses again to become a demon. Angered at his refusal, Akaza activates his Blood Demon Art, a glowing aura called Technique Development, Destructive Death: Compass Needle. As he prepares to fight, Akaza tell Kyojuro his refusal will only lead to his demise. Akaza and Kyojuro trade blows. He rushes forward and strikes, while Kyojuro parries his numerous blows and returns the attacks: the clash can't be followed by Tanjiro, who is too slow to see the battle. Akaza taunts him by mentioning none of the Hashira he faced were Flame Hashiras and that everyone he's killed refused his offer, confused at why. Kyojuro manages to slice his forearm off but Akaza heals the wound instantly. Akaza leaps into the air and uses Destructive Death: Air Type, sending numerous shockwaves at the Hashira. Kyojuro blocks the incoming assault with Flame Breathing, Fourth Form: Blooming Flame Undulation. Realizing a battle at range will prove tricky, Kyojuro rushes towards Akaza to close the gap and narrowly catches his neck. Akaza, unfazed, continues his numerous blows while taunting Kyojuro that his skills will be wasted if he die, while he continues to deny his words. Inosuke sees the confrontation while Tanjiro attempts to stand, but Kyojuro orders them not to interfere. Kyojuro attacks with Third Form: Blazing Universe. Kyojuro knocks Akaza into a nearby forest and manages to slash his arm again, leading Akaza to violently kick him back in response. sending the Hashira hurtling hard into the dirt. He tries again to goad Kyojuro to transform, healing his sliced arm instantly. Kyojuro again refuses and leaps into the air, using Flame Breathing, Third Form: Blazing Universe to slash down. Akaza dodges the blow and commends him for his spirit, launching another Destructive Death: Air Type shockwave and narrowing missing him. Inosuke, watching the battle, realizes the two are on a different dimension and himself joining the clash will only result in his death. Akaza angered at Kyojuro's refusal. Akaza continues to try and get to Kyojuro but he refuses once again. The Upper Rank starts to make contact, first cutting Kyojuro's forehead with the side of his fist. Kyojuro speeds forward and twist his body into a Flame Breathing, First Form: Unknowing Fire. The attack slices both of Akaza's arms but he heals instantly and continues his assault. He suddenly strikes the Hashira with a punch directly to the side. Kyojuro staggers back in pain but continues to fight back, using Second Form: Rising Scorching Sun slash to catch his arms again. Akaza dodges the slice and punches directly at Kyojuro's face. Though his sword blocks his fist, Akaza pushes ahead and his hand slips off, hitting Kyojuro's eye and rupturing it. Akaza dispels Kyojuro's Flame Tiger with Destructive Death: Disorder. Kyojuro presses on and uses Flame Breathing, Third Form: Blazing Universe and Fourth Form: Blooming Flame Undulation in succession, in the hopes he hits Akaza. The demon leaps back to safety and takes another stance. Kyojuro then uses Flame Breathing, Fifth Form: Flame Tiger, releasing the fiery wave at the Upper Rank. Akaza responds with Destructive Death: Disorder, dissipating the infernal attack and rushes Kyojuro with another punch. Kyojuro enters the clash and slashes his arm. Once the fire dissipates, Inosuke questions aloud if Kyojuro had succeeded. Bleeding from his wounds, the Hashira stands and breathes heavily, whereas Akaza instantly heals his sliced arm and rises up.

As his own injuries heal quickly, the demon urges the Hashira to transform, as this final wound will kill him. Kyojuro suddenly remembers his mother Ruka and sees a memory of her during his childhood. Shortly before her death, she had one last conversation with him about why he is stronger than others. When he responds he doesn't know the reason, Ruka tells him it is to protect those weaker than him: ""It is the duty of those born strong to protect the weak"", the promise becoming the drive that pushes him as a Hashira. Ruka hugs Kyojuro and tells him she is blessed to have such a strong and gentle son, as both mother and son tear up in a tender embrace.

Inosuke becomes shaken at seeing Tanjiro lose his composure but Kyojuro smiles gently at his young Demon Slayer's words. He urges him to stop yelling and risk reopening his wound. Kyojuro invites Tanjiro for a final conversation before his death. He explains that during his dream, his father often read notes made by the previous Flame Hashira and that the notes may contain information about Hinokami Kagura that he didn't know, instructing him to visit the Rengoku residence of the Demon Slayer Corps. With the sun fully risen, Akaza's torn arm burns to ash and Kyojuro's wound bleeds quicker.

However, Shinjuro sees Tanjiro’s earrings and suddenly becomes enraged. What will Tanjiro discover at the Rengoku residence?[1] Senjuro Rengoku learns of Kyojuro's death. Muzan's disguise as a human child. Remembering Kyojuro Rengoku's battle with Akaza and recalling his final words, Tanjiro begins to cry for his esteemed friend. Zenitsu and Inosuke too burst into tears, Inosuke himself fighting hard and yelling that they would continue to train, while Kakushi arrive to assist them. Kyojuro's own Kasugai Crow reports his death to the Rengoku residence, where his brother Senjuro Rengoku is informed of the incident, causing him to fall to the floor in tears. Another Kasugai crow reports to the Demon Slayer Corps, where Kagaya Ubuyashiki is told of Tanjiro's furious confrontation with Upper Rank Three.
Elsewhere, a family talks about their adopted son Toshikuni, praising him for his intelligence and kind nature. The boy, having borrowed a botany book from the library, begins to read it for a certain plant. Suddenly, the room's curtains shake open and Akaza appears, reporting to Toshikuni who is, in actuality, a disguised Muzan Kibutsuji. As his blue eyes turn back into their demonic plum red, Muzan hears Akaza's report of his inability to find the Blue Spider Lily. Akaza also adds that he had killed a Hashira. Akaza is punished by Muzan. Infuriated, Muzan takes hold Akaza's cells and causes him to decay and bleed heavily. As Akaza fights the pain, Muzan angrily accosts him for boasting that he had killed a Hashira telling him that he seems to have the wrong idea if he was expecting praise for it. Since to him it is logical for demons to kill humans, he asks why he feels so proud when three other Demon Slayers were also present and could have been killed as well and telling him that he was sent there since he had happened to be nearby. Angered and disappointed, he dismisses Akaza for his failure, reminding him of taking a blow from a non-Hashira swordsman. Alone in a forest, Akaza hurls Tanjiro's Nichirin Sword into a nearby tree. Remembering that Tanjiro had called him a coward, Akaza furiously punches the sword into pieces, before declaring that he would spill his brains the next time they meet, now able to recognize his face. In the Butterfly Mansion, Zenitsu ponders on their situation; he is stunned to think Kyojuro's death brought even the optimistic Tanjiro to despair and hopelessness and had caused the hardened and brash Inosuke to bawl his eyes out. Having stolen some bean buns from Aoi, he tries to give one to Tanjiro, only to bump into a shaken and hysterical Kiyo. She fearfully worries for Tanjiro, who had continued to train despite not recovering fully and is now nowhere to be found. Shinjuro Rengoku. Tanjiro, who had been following Kyojuro's Kasugai crow, arrives at the Rengoku residence. He then sees Senjuro, with a saddened expression from hearing of his brother's passing. Tanjiro arrives to relay him Kyojuro's message, only to hear a drunken Shinjuro Rengoku accuse the message to be worthless. He rants that Kyojuro's worthlessness and lack of talent had gotten him killed, denouncing him as a fool of a son. He angrily tells his remaining son to stop grieving his brother's death, as Senjuro fights hard to stop crying. Unable to believe what he is hearing, Tanjiro steps in and demands he stops insulting his late son. Shinjuro suddenly sees his earrings and angrily tells him he is a user of Sun Breathing. Not knowing what it is, Tanjiro is suddenly tackled to the floor by the former Flame Hashira, who hits away Senjuro for trying to stop the fight. Tanjiro breaks free of his hold, only for Shinjuro to angrily claim he had arrived to mock them as a Sun Breathing user. He explains Sun Breathing is the original and the most powerful breathing technique of all, the others styles had been mimics of it. When Shinjuro tells him not to get cocky for being a Sun Breathing user, Tanjiro breaks down and asks if Shinjuro is unable to see his own weakness has caused him despair from being unable to save Kyojuro. As he sprints towards Shinjuro and readies a punch, the former Hashira grabs him and violently punches his face repeatedly, until Tanjiro headbutts him to stop. Later, Tanjiro apologizes to Senjuro for headbutting his father, but he is informed Shinjuro has already left to buy more sake. Senjuro thanks him for defending his late brother, as he believes himself unable to stand up for him. He presents Tanjiro with the records created by the past Flame Hashira, only for both to be shocked to see the pages ripped when they open it. Senjuro apologizes, believing his father had torn the pages, though Tanjiro dismisses the apology, instead stating he would train harder and master his Hinokami Kagura. Senjuro gives Tanjiro his brother's tsuba. Tanjiro declares to Senjuro that he will one day become a Hashira like Kyojuro, no matter what it takes. This causes Senjuro to cry, as his brother didn't have a Tsuguko and he himself is not a powerful swordsman, his Nichirin Sword even was unable to change colour. As he sadly states he would cause the long line of generational Flame Hashira to break, he believes Kyojuro wouldn't have been upset. Before Tanjiro departs, Senjuro tries to give him Kyojuro's tsuba. Tanjiro refuses, not wanting to be given such a valuable item, though Senjuro insists. Later that evening, Senjuro attempts to talk to his father about Kyojuro's final message to him. Shinjuro angrily dismisses him, calling it worthless and believing the message is something bad about him. Senjuro relays Kyojuro's message, ""Please take care of yourself"", before quietly leaving. Now by himself, Shinjuro sets his drink down and begins to mourn his son's death alone. The Kamado siblings as recognized Demon Slayers. As he walks home, Tanjiro suddenly sees his sword's maker Haganezuka, armed with two knives. Angered at him losing another one of his blades, he chases Tanjiro for an entire day, until Aoi rescues him and calms Haganezuka down. For the next four months after Kyojuro's death, Tanjiro, Inosuke and Zenitsu continue to train together, in order to able to fight and slay demons once again. Later on, Tanjiro battles a spider-like demon, with Nezuko supporting him, since she is now recognized by the Demon Slayer Corps. They chase the demon out of a mountain temple and corner it into a shed, before Tanjiro defeats it using Water Breathing, Fourth Form: Striking Tide. Returning from his mission tired, Tanjiro hears a cry for help from Aoi. The Sound Hashira, Tengen Uzui, had arrived to the Butterfly Mansion and proceeded to forcefully kidnap both Aoi and Naho. As Kiyo and Sumi cry for their release, Kanao panics. Without Shinobu and seeing her superior abducting her friends, she tries to rationalize the situation with a coin toss to decide. Suddenly remembering Tanjiro's words to follow her heart, she unexpectedly stops Tengen in his tracks, attempting to pull Aoi and Naho free. Kanao attempts to save Aoi and Naho. Kiyo and Sumi assist her, though they do little more than inconvenience the far more powerful Demon Slayer. Tanjiro arrives and accosts Tengen for his actions, trying to headbutt him. Without warning, Tengen disappears and lands onto a nearby gate arch, while Tanjiro and Kanao help Kiyo and Sumi up. Tengen tried to announce his title as a former Shinobi and that he is able to take them for his mission without Shinobu's permission. Upon learning Naho isn't a Demon Slayer, he promptly drops her, forcing Tanjiro to run in and catch her from falling. Angered at his actions, Tanjiro refuses to acknowledge him as a Hashira, infuriating Tengen, who believes their ""unflashiness"" is why the Demon Slayer Corps is getting weaker. Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke offer themselves to help Tengen. Tanjiro, still attempting to free Aoi, declares that ""we"" would accompany Tengen for his mission. Not knowing who ""we"" is, he is answered by the sudden appearance of both Zenitsu and Inosuke. Together, they announce they will join him. Satisfied he has the three to accompany him, Tengen warns them not to defy him again, before slapping Aoi from behind. As they leave the Butterfly Mansion, the three stand behind Tengen, waiting for orders. As Zenitsu marvels as his immense stature, Inosuke impatiently asks where they will be going. Tengen answers, ""The number-one spot in Japan that's dripping with lust and desire. A super-flashy place. The Entertainment District, where demons reside"".

35,Infiltrating the Entertainment District,Tengen declaring that he is a god.,"Tanjiro and Inosuke are not aware of what a red-light district is, causing Zenitsu to be flustered at their naivety. The Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui quickly announces himself as a god and addresses the trio as trash, telling them to pound it into their heads as the first thing. Though Zenitsu is unable to believe what Tengen is saying, Tanjiro asks what he is the specific god of, to his friend's bewilderment. Tengen answers he is ""the god of Flashiness"" and ""the god of Festivals"". Inosuke joins and calls himself the ""King of the Mountain"", only to confuse Tengen and infuriate Zenitsu even more so at their brash confidence. Tengen decides to lead the mission and runs on ahead, his speed amazing the three Demon Slayers. Entertainment District of Yoshiwara, Tokyo. The party arrive in to their destination; Tanjiro looks on in wonder of everything unfamiliar to him. Though Tengen instructs them not to stray, the three immediately leave him to look around, angering him. He explains they are in the Yoshiwara Red-Light District. Inosuke is ecstatic at the numerous people and Zenitsu becomes infatuated with the women beckoning him, causing the Hashira to chase after the two to keep them on track. Tengen explains the district becomes active only at night, making it ideal for a demon to hide in. In a house, Tengen instructs the three to look for his wife while he gathers intel on the potential demon; Zenitsu angrily refuses to cooperate, believing he is sending them out to find a bride, only for Tengen to clarify she has been gathering intel as well. When presented with the letters he's been given, Tanjiro initially thinks she had been undercover for a long time, only for Tengen to correct him by saying he has three wives, infuriating Zenitsu even more and causing Tengen to punch him in annoyance at his antics. Reading the letters, Tanjiro asks what is meant by ""not to stand out"". To this, Tengen informs them their job is to disguise themselves. He states that his first attempt to investigate the district was as a customer, which proved unsuccessful. He then sent his three wives to three houses to gather information; Suma at the Tokito House, Makio at the Ogimoto House and Hinatsuru at the Kyogoku House. Inosuke suddenly barks out his wives might be dead, causing Tengen to angrily punch him as well. An attendant then arrives with a box of items for Tengen. The trio disguised as girls. Tengen presents the three, crudely dressed in makeup, to the Tokito house, hoping one of them would be taken in and begin the mission. Though the owners are shocked at their appearance, the house's madam happily agrees to take one in, taken aback by Tengen's handsomeness. Tanjiro, with the cover name Sumiko, is taken. Tengen scolds Zenitsu and Inosuke for the hopelessness of being put in a house, whereas Zenitsu refuses to talk, angered not at having to be dressed as a girl but by Tengen's attractive appearance. The three witness Tokito House's Oiran Koinatsu and her yūjo courtesans walking to her next client through the process of ""oiran walkdochu"" (花魁噵中, oiran dōchū?), with Zenitsu asking if she is Tengen's wife. Tengen answers with a no and another punch. Inosuke is suddenly approached by a woman, a chaperone to the Ogimoto house. When asked if she is able to take Inosuke, Tengen obliges. Thus, Inosuke, with the cover name Inoko, is the second to be taken, leaving a shocked Zenitsu last. At the Ogimoto House, Inosuke's make up is removed and the attendants are shocked at his pretty face hidden under the ugly makeup. The house is glad they had taken ""her"" at a low price, though they are additionally shocked by his muscular frame. At the Kyogoku House where Zenitsu is, the Demon Slayer puts on a stellar shamisen performance, aided by his Total Concentration, Constant and enhance sense of hearing. Zenitsu playing while enraged at Tengen. The house's girls talk about the newcomer's instrumental talent but comment on her ugly appearance, instead being smitten by Tengen, who had brought Zenitsu to the house and given him the cover name Zenko. Despite this, the house's madam believes Zenko would rise quickly, noting her performance is driven by anger ""to get back at the man who abandoned her"". Zenitsu, furious at Tengen's humiliating treatment of him, swears he will become the top Oiran of Yoshiwara. Tanjiro running errands in the Tokito House. At the Tokito House, Tanjiro is hard at work doing various chores. As he lifts a set of gifts to another story, he overhears some girls talking about the recent death of the Kyogoku house's madam. They also talk to him about 'Ashinuke': the act of a prostitute leaving her house without paying her debts over love, mentioning a recent Oiran named Suma had done so. Tanjiro suddenly remembers Suma is the name of one of Tengen's wives. Koinatsu interrupts their chat, telling them to stop spreading rumors and adding it is uncertain what became of Suma. She thanks Tanjiro for bring her gifts up to her room with an bag of orange ame-honpo candies. He tries to ask if Suma had really commited Ashinuke, causing Koinatsu to be alarmed at such a sensitive question. Tanjiro asks Koinatsu on Suma's leave. Realizing this, Tanjiro attempts to lie and claim that Suma is his older sister, but his honest nature clashes with his lie and causes his face to contort. With great difficulty, he spits out he had entered the district looking for her. Tanjiro assures them that Suma wouldn't have left suddenly and Koinatsu confirms this, commenting she was seemingly a grounded girl and without any hint of being in love with a man. Tengen surveying the district from the roof of a building. Tengen, rearmed and on the rooftops, scans the district for any trace. Though the area is quiet, he cannot shake the feeling of uncertainty, believing the demon they are hunting is an Upper Rank. Elsewhere, Inosuke becomes annoyed at the kimono he is forced to wear hampering his senses. While wandering the halls, he overhears some attendants talking about Makio and remembers she is another of Tengen's wives. They worry about Makio not wanting to leave her room and claiming she is unwell. Inosuke decides to head to the opposite direction of where they came; when one girl calls out to ""Inoko"", he doesn't respond, instructed by Tengen not to speak due to his husky voice. Behind the door Inosuke had walked past, a woman is revealed to be tortured and bound by several long sashes. The demon asks her about the letters she is writing and who she is writing to, addressing her by her name; Makio.

36,What Are You?,"During the Edo era, in a brothel in Yoshiwara, an attendant confronts an Oiran as she puts on her makeup, accusing her for multiple disappearances within the house. The attendant enters the room and closes the door, only for the prostitute to exit moments later, the attendant vanishing without a trace. In the Ogimoto House, a captured Makio is questioned on who the letters are for, the demon calling her by name. Sensing something, Inosuke investigates. In the Kyogoku House, Zenitsu ponders that since entering the house, he has not heard a word about Hinatsuru despite remaining vigilant. The recent death of the house's owner also hampers his mission as everyone is tight-lipped and afraid.","Zenitsu hears a girl crying. Deciding to try again, he hones his hearing and detects multiple voices throughout the house. He suddenly hears someone crying and deduces it is a young girl. Back in the Ogimoto House, the demon detects someone approaching, becoming annoyed at the house's busyness. Makio tries to think of a way to inform Tengen but the demon's sashes rapidly twist and constrict her torso tightly. The demon threatens to crush her organs should she make a commotion. Inosuke looks at the quiet room with food left out for Makio, feeling a creepy vibe emanating from it as he thinks of a plan. Suddenly, he mutters than sitting and thinking without action is not who he is and he barges into Makio's room. Upon seeing it, he becomes shocked at its destroyed and disheveled appearance, with papers and pillows torn and slash marks throughout the walls. He notices the debris floating about despite the windows closed and no wind entering, then hurls a ramen bowl at the attic and angrily shouts he is onto the demon. Inosuke chasing the demon. The ceiling begins to shake and the demon leaves the room, with Inosuke running through the halls in pursuit. He crashes through multiple walls in an attempt to follow it, even punching a client for entering his path, leaving a large hole in the wall. Using his Beast Breathing, Seventh Form: Spatial Awareness, he senses the demon fleeing downstairs, running to the bottom of the house. With the kimono hampering his senses, he loses track of it, angrily saying its escape was because of the people in his way. Warabihime appears behind Zenitsu. In the Kyogoku House, Zenitsu enters the room he sensed had a young girl crying inside. Shocked by its destroyed appearance, he loudly questions the girl, asking if she had been in a fight. Shaken, the young girl cries harder, causing Zenitsu to calm down and ask if she is okay. He quietly tells her he is not angry, simply asking if she if in trouble. All of the sudden, he senses a demon behind him, the demon angrily asking what he is doing inside her room. Terrified, he notices she only appeared when she started to speak to him, believing the demon might be an Upper Rank. The demon, revealed to be Kyogoku House's Oiran Warabihime, is told by two young girls that ""Zenko"" only arrived two days ago. Warabihime ignores their words, frightening the girls. Zenitsu apologizes for intruding but Warabihime only mocks him for ""her"" ugly appearance and yellow hair. She approaches the young girl assigned to clean the room, then grabs her ear harshly, ignoring her screams of pain. The girl cries and says she will clean up, begging for forgiveness as her ear starts to bleed. Instantly, Zenitsu grabs Warabihime's arm and demands she stop. In the Tokito House, Tanjiro continues to do chores quickly and diligently. The house's madam becomes stunned at his want to do chores, having run out of tasks for him to do. In the Ogimoto house, the chaperone and two attendants witness the giant hole in the wall recently made by Inosuke. She decides to confront ""Inoko"" for the vandalism, only to be surprised seeing Inosuke, focused and with his legs over his head, trying to sense the demon. Zenitsu demanding Warabihime to let the girl go. Zenitsu repeats his words, demanding Warabihime let go of the young girl. Infuriated, she lets go of her and rips her hand from Zenitsu's grasp. Suddenly, she swings her fist back and strikes him in the face. Two days before the mission to Yoshiwara, Kyogoku House's owner, Omitsu, confronts Warabihime, demanding she stop causing girls to get hurt, commit Ashinuke and even commit suicide, saying she bullied them to death. Warabihime appears ignorant at the accusations, asking Omitsu if she'd taken consideration the girls had simple should not have annoyed her, then scathingly reminds her most of the house's earnings were through her as an Oiran. Omitsu relays a story she was told when she was young by an older woman, about certain Oirans, incredibly beautiful but incredibly twisted. The woman had seen such Oirans when she was young and later when she was middle-aged; the Oirans had ""hime"" at the end of their name and would cock their heads to the side and glare angrily if something annoyed them. Seeing Warabihime doing just that, Omitsu, armed with a knife, angrily confronts her for what she is, questioning if she is even human. Daki taunting Omitsu before killing her. In a flash, Warabihime grabs her in her sashes and takes to the sky. Dangling the helpless woman over the ground, she mockingly tells her she should have kept quiet the moment she senses something. Now undisguised, her eyes reveals her true identity as Upper Rank Six of the Twelve Kizuki. She tells her not to be afraid, as she hates the taste of old, ugly or dirty people, before mercilessly dropping Omitsu to her death below. As people on the street happen upon her corpse, Warabihime returns to her room, only to see Muzan Kibutsuji inside. Addressing him as Master Muzan, she kneels down before him, as he commends her for eating numerous people and gaining more strength. Muzan advises her to remain vigilant as she gets stronger, as any skilled Demon Slayer can immediately tell demons from humans. Calling her by her demon name, Daki, Muzan compliments her for her beauty and strength, as she had previously killed seven Hashira, before telling her she is an extraordinary demon. Daki ""apologizes"" for attacking Zenitsu. Zenitsu gets flung through several walls and is knocked unconscious, Daki angrily demanding she isn't touched. The house's master appears, calming asking she forgive Zenko and reminding her that customers will soon appear to the house. Daki smiles and calmly states she was perhaps too merciless, asking they treat her wounds. She tells the master she should be apologizing, as things had left her irritated. The master quickly demands the mess cleaned up and nothing to be done that displeases ""Warabihime"". Daki realizes the blow to Zenitsu hasn't damaged him severely and he had quickly went on the defensive, deducing him to be a Demon Slayer but not a Hashira. As she puts on her makeup, she mutters to herself that ""you did a good job bringing him in"", declaring she would happily devour them all. Tanjiro, still doing chores, suddenly detects a murky scent in the air, a scent that has only appeared at night. Zenitsu wakes up and sees the three young girls glad ""Zenko"" now awake. They tell him he was punched and was knocked unconscious, offering him food and a towel for the mark on his cheek. Hearing the pain in his voice as he tends to his injury, the girl he protected sadly tells him pain is what he got for defending her from Warabihime. Zenitsu recovering in a room. Zenitsu dissuades her words, telling her ""Any man would rescue a damsel in distress. That's a given"", though he doubles down on his words and tells them he is the eldest daughter and he can't stand when a younger girl cries. The girls bid him good will and leave him to rest. As he quietly admires their kind attitude by himself, Daki abducts him without warning. ","There is an anime-original scene involving Daki getting confronted by an attendant during the Edo era., This episode animates two pages from the Volume 9 extras, namely of Inosuke stretching with his legs over his head and Tanjiro being very proactive in doing chores., Zenitsu getting abducted by Daki's sashes while recovering in a room does not appear in the manga."
37,Tonight,Koinatsu with her assistants,"In the Tokito House, Koinatsu's young assistants ask her to read them books. Before she does so, she graciously gives the two treasured hirauchi kanzashi hairpins meant for her, saying she wants them to have it. Elsewhere, in the Kyogoku House, a chaperone informs the owner that ""Zenko"" is missing, but he angrily refuses to let them search for her, not wanting to do anything that might upset ""Warabihime"". Above the district rooftops, Tanjiro and Inosuke discuss their situation; Inosuke informs him that there is a demon in his house but his unusual way of describing it only confuses Tanjiro. They are then joined by Tengen, who states that Zenitsu will not be arriving. Tengen explains Zenitsu's disappearance to Tanjiro and Inosuke. When Tanjiro asks what he meant by that statement, Tengen only tells them of his regret in making them join him in his mission; his urge to rescue his wives has led to Zenitsu going missing. The Sound Hashira dismisses the younger Demon Slayers as he believes them incapable of handling an Upper Rank demon should they face it. When Tanjiro tries to voice his support, Tengen only tells him there is no shame in leaving the mission before vanishing from the two. Tanjiro believes he thinks so as they are the lowest rank, only for Inosuke to inform him they have in fact gone up, the three now three up from Mizunoto to Kanoe. Inosuke then displays his rank by flexing his arm and saying his rank, the mark appearing on his forearm. Told he has one too and that it is a sign they are now Demon Slayers, a re-motivated Tanjiro tells Inosuke he must wait for him so they can start investigating the Ogimoto House together. Inosuke disagrees, leading the two to quarrel until Tanjiro clears up his statement by saying the demon in his house is still nowhere to be found and Zenitsu is still missing, believing there is a passageway between the three houses allowing the demon to travel between them. Tanjiro adds that he thinks the demon has disguised itself as a human and it would be careful about killing people to prevent blowing cover. Inosuke concurs, as a murder and bloodshed would be difficult to clean. Due to the district's nightly activity convenient for demons, he believes Zenitsu and Tengen's wives are all still alive. With the plan set, Tanjiro tells Inosuke to look for them and stay alive, Inosuke agreeing to the terms. In the Tokito House, the girls give Koinatsu her tea and she dismisses them for dinner. Left alone, Koinsatsu is suddenly joined by Tanjiro, re-equipped with his uniform and Nichirin sword. He gives her his payment for the master during his time spent in the house. Seeing her surprised by his uniform, Tanjiro informs her he had to be disguised, only for Koinatsu to tell him that she knew all along he wasn't a girl, to his shock. Tanjiro bids farewell to Koinatsu. Tanjiro tells her he will be rescuing all who have gone missing. The oiran visibly relaxes at his words, as she will be leaving the district to be married, to Tanjiro's joy. She mentions she had worried for the missing as she is about to leave, telling Tanjiro to stay safe and not disappear too. Tanjiro bids her farewell and wishes her happiness; she thanks ""Sumi"" and returns the sentiment. As she continues preparing, she hears something and asks if he had left something. Instead, Daki appears before the young woman, telling her she won't forget to devour her before she leaves the district. As Tanjiro runs to the Ogimoto house, he pauses and detects the scent of a demon nearby. In the Ogimoto House, Inosuke becomes angered at Tanjiro not joining him, deciding to take action instead. He jumps up, slams his head into the ceiling and commands ""Hey mice! My swords!"". In the shadows, two Ninju appear, holding Inosuke's blades and walking towards him. Inosuke compliments Tengen for training the mice as his personal servants to call upon. Re-armed, he bursts out his room to battle, to the surprise of a nearby chaperone. Tengen threatens the Master of the Kyogoku House for information. In the Kyogoku House, the owner stares at his wife's bloodied kimono only to hear a voice ask about Zenko and Hinatsuru's whereabouts. Tengen appears and threatens the man with a kunai to the neck. Terrified, the owner only states that Zenko had disappeared and Hinatsuru had fallen ill and was taken to the Kirimise, the poorer section of the district. Tucking his blade, Tengen tells him he can be trusted and asks for everything he knows. The owner tells him of the oiran named Warabihime, in the room on the north side without light. With his information, Tengen disappears and leaves the man bewildered at his sudden visitor. Entering the room and seeing it empty, Tengen surmises the demon is now hunting and runs across the district roofs, heading to where Hinatsuru is likely at, reasoning she might still be alive and with information. Tengen believes the demon should return to the room during daybreak, declaring he will kill it. Koinatsu captured by Daki. Returning to the now dark Tokito House, Tanjiro opens the windows to warn Koinatsu. Instead, he meets Daki. She asks if he is a Demon Slayer, then asks how many of them are there, knowing Zenitsu is one. Unanswered, she asks if there is a Hashira with them, believing Tanjiro isn't at a Hashira's level, as she stares at Koinatsu absorbed into her obi. She turns to him and says she never eats dirty, old or ugly people. Tanjiro sees the kanjis in her eyes and realizes she is Upper Rank Six. He draws his blade and demands she let Koinatsu go, angering Daki. She swats him away with her obi, sending him into a nearby house. Tanjiro uses Fourth Form: Striking Tide, Turbulent. Stunned by the impact, Tanjiro takes a moment to will himself to fight and gets up, steeling his resolve to face her. He realizes her main weapons is her obi; with the ability to absorb people, he realizes it's the reason he was unable to find a secret path big enough for a human, since it only needs a thin crack to pass through and absorb someone. Daki sees he survived the impact, before complimenting his eyes, saying she would gouge and devour them later. The strap holding Nezuko's box breaks, leading him to set it down. Tanjiro tells Nezuko not to leave the box unless her life is in danger. Using Water Breathing, Fourth Form: Striking Tide, Turbulent, Tanjiro leaps into the air to face her, Daki retaliating by sending her obi sashes. Tanjiro attempts to cut them but the obi initially prove too durable for his blade. Tanjiro resolves to fight Daki. Eventually, he slices one but Daki punches him towards the ground. As he slow his fall, Daki lands down too and compliments him for his decent mid-air battle, as well as for separating the one sash containing Koinatsu. As he tries to regain his breath, the demon comments of her fondness of him. Trying to rationalize he is now facing Upper Rank Six, Tanjiro reasons whether he can battle her without Tengen, Zenitsu, or Inosuke. He then declares it's not a matter of could he do it but that he has to do it. Raising his blade, he prepares himself to face Daki alone.

38,Things Are Gonna Get Real Flashy!!,"After gaining information about Warabihime Oiran from the master of the Kyogoku House, Uzui suspects that she is a demon. While continuing to search for a sign of the demon, he rushes to find Hinatsuru, who has moved to a different place for her sickness, and discovers that she has been captured by Daki’s belt. Meanwhile, facing an uphill battle with Daki, Tanjiro must try to break through the situation by using an advanced Technique...[1]","Tengen embracing Hinatsuru. Running across the rooftops, Tengen reaches the Kirimise section of Yoshiwara. He quickly sees his unconscious wife Hinatsuru, still bound by demonic sashes. He frees her, gives Hinatsuru an antidote to help recover her as she apologizes. She states that she suspected Warabihime to be a demon but that she soon became suspicious of her too. She adds that she had drank poison in order to leave the Kyogoku house, only for a belt she was gifted by Warabihime to prevent her from contacting Tengen. Hinatsuru quietly begs him to leave her and battle the demon, having heard the battle. When he asks if she will be okay, Hinatsuru silently answers before apologizes for being of no use. Tengen silences her and instruct her to leave Yoshiwara the moment the antidote works, to which Hinatsuru complies. Tengen using Sound Breathing, First Form: Roar to dig into the ground. He leaps across the rooftops of the district to scan for a demon; he hears something and triangulates its position, getting close to the ground and detecting the sound of an underground battle. He unsheathes his blades and uses Sound Breathing, First Form: Roar, causing a large explosion. The shockwave is heard by Daki. Annoyed at another interference, she asks Tanjiro how many of them are there, to which he refuses to answer. She offers to spare his life if he answers, noting that their short clash had already damaged his Nichirin Sword. Hearing her mock Haganezuka's craftsmanship, he rebuffs her claims and declares he is amazing. Another explosions rattles the district, causing Daki to grow more annoyed and declare she will instead kill him. Realizing subpar usage causes swords to get damage, Tanjiro admits his body isn't suited for Water Breathing and realizes he is simply stronger using Hinokami Kagura. He recalls a moment of training in the Butterfly Mansion. As Inosuke spars with Zenitsu, Zenitsu asks if he could slightly suppress his ferocity, to which Inosuke claims holding back is no way to train. Suddenly, they hear Tanjiro attempting to train with Hinokami Kagura. Though he successfully performs Hinokami Kagura: Dance, swinging again to try Clear Blue Sky hurts him greatly, causing him to drop his sword and collapse. As his friends rush over to his aid, Tanjiro internally voices that he can't slash continuously due to its sheer force. Tanjiro uses Hinokami Kagura: Raging Sun Now facing Daki, he commits himself into using it. Remembering Kyojuro's word to ""set your heart ablaze"". Tanjiro swings at Daki's approaching obi and performs Hinokami Kagura: Raging Sun. Startled by the sudden change, Daki realizes his skills have just sharpened. Tanjiro charges towards the Upper Rank and uses Flame Dance, narrowly missing her neck. Daki retaliates by stabbing her obi through his throat, only for the Demon Slayer to suddenly vanish. She loses track of him as he had used Hinokami Kagura: Fake Rainbow. He senses the Opening Thread at her neck and uses the Hinokami Kagura: Fire Wheel; Daki reacts in time and swats him away with her obi. Tanjiro fends off Daki's obi attacks. Suddenly, his body feels the fatigue of using multiple Hinokami Kagura forms and Tanjiro collapses. Seeing him on the ground, Daki rushes towards him, dragging her obi to rip him to shreds. He quickly uses Recovery Breathing, building the strength to parry the attack and escapes. She sends multiple obi at him and he desperately blocks the blows, realizing the overwhelming attacks are preventing him from dealing a clean strike. He surmises he needs to raise his body temperature and breathes in the style of Hinokami Kagura. Previously, Kiyo had worried about his rising temperature and believes consulting Shinobu to be the right measure. Tanjiro tries to calm her down and claims he is alright. Kiyo notes his temperature is 100.4° Fahrenheit, having been so for the past two days. She begins to cry and claims that since something must be wrong, only Shinobu can help him. Realizing his worsening condition is upsetting Kiyo, Tanjiro states that only during when he has a fever can he perform at his best and begs her not to tell Shinobu for only slightly longer. Kiyo relents and allows him to not lower his fever. Tanjiro backs away and realizes his body temperature is indeed rising, giving him the motivation to use his Hinokami Kagura again. In the Ogimito house, a girl screams about a monster boar inside, to the bewilderment of her peers. At that moment, Inosuke erupts out from the floorboards, scaring them. He rips a hole in the floor and spots a hold leading underground, though it is only small enough for only his head. Inosuke finds Daki's victims Undaunted, he dislocates all the joints in his body and slithers down the tunnel, reaching a chamber littered with skulls and covered in sashes; the sashes containing Daki's victims. He realizes the people within them are still alive, before spotting Zenitsu's image on one of them. Just them, a sash confronts him for entering the chamber, the sash having a face and mouth. It attacks Inosuke and forces him to defend the incoming blows. Daki giving instructions to the sentient Obi. He slashes the obi and unknowingly frees the people within them. The sash, unable to deal with his razor sharp intuition and keen senses, halts for a moment and tries to plan something. It hears Daki's voice, instructing it to capture him for his appearance, adding the sash may kill everyone but the ten most beautiful people. It speeds towards Inosuke, who swings his swords to slice it. Unexpectedly, the sash wriggles when his blades touch, preventing good contact. He tries again and uses Beast Breathing, Sixth Form: Palisade Bite but fails to cut it. The sash decides to retake the people he freed, making him realize that he needs to battle it and protect its victims at the same time. Makio and Suma join the battle. Suddenly, knives fly from behind him and stop the sashes, thrown by Makio and Suma. The two slice the sashes up but the battle is set back slightly by Suma's cowardice and Makio snapping at her in annoyance. Learning that the main body of the demon isn't near, Inosuke realizes the battle might not end. To his shock, Zenitsu appears and uses Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash, Sixfold, speeding around the chamber and slicing numerous sashes at once. Tengen slices the remaining obis. Infuriated by the appearance of another Demon Slayer, the sash remembers it heard two distinct noises, one being Zenitsu's attack. It realizes too late that the second sound is from above, as an explosion erupts from the top of the chamber's ceiling. To the relief of everyone, Tengen emerges from the dust cloud and he rushes around the chamber, cutting all the remaining sashes. Tengen apologizes to his wives for being late and says his relief in seeing them. Makio recalls that Tengen previously wasn't like he is now and remembers her past. As a Kunoichi among other Shinobi, dying never scared her since she was expected and trained to give her life in battle. When Tengen first met the three of them, he immediately instructed them to think about their lives, to the shock of the young women. Above all, their priority is to return to him. To Tengen, how they should live their lives is first about them, second is being respectful citizens and thirdly is focusing on him. And to himself, though he knows to protect the public as a Demon Slayer, he places the three of them as more important to him. Unable to believe what he is saying, Makio talks to Hinatsuru about his advice, as she knows it contradicts their line of work. Hinatsuru reassures her that if Tengen is content with it, she is too. ""Starting now, things are going to get real flashy!"" Tengen approaches them and playfully pats their heads, complimenting their work as ""flashy"" and happy that, ""You are my wives, all right"". Makio tears up and Suma loudly wails upon realizing Tengen does love them. He flamboyantly spins his swords in a display of skill and mutters, ""Starting now, things are going to get real flashy!"".

39,Layered Memories,"Facing Daki alone, Tanjiro uses Hinokami Kagura: Raging Sun to slice her incoming obis. He charges towards her and evades her frontal attack with Fake Rainbow, before using Fire Wheel in an attempt to slice her neck. Daki sees the incoming attack and hits him away, sending him flying into the dirt. He narrowly dodges getting ripped to pieces by the attacking Upper Rank with Recovery Breathing, due to the fatigue from using multiple Hinokami Kagura forms. She then sends blow after blow with her obis, forcing Tanjiro on the defensive.","Tanjiro vs Daki. Daki approaches Tanjiro, as he tries to regain composure and order his breathing again. Angrily calling him an ""ugly piece of trash"", she sends her obi ripping across the district, forcing Tanjiro to defend her attacks again. Daki leaps into the air and two sashes suddenly connects to her, to Tanjiro's surprise. From the cave, the obi escape out the hole made by Tengen's Sound Breathing and fly into the sky and reattach themselves to Daki. Daki at her full strength. Wondering if they're the obi he had previously sliced off, he watches as she absorbs them into her body while he tries to compose his breathing. He swings at the demon but Daki vanishes instantly. Reappearing on the rooftops, she exclaims she was right that a Hashira has indeed arrived, as her hair turns white. She proclaims Muzan will now be proud of her. Tanjiro is shocked at her transformation, noting she has grown even more powerful, as well as wondering on Tengen and company's whereabouts. A man confronts Tanjiro for creating a disturbance in front of his House. Tanjiro becomes nervous as civilians begin to notice the battle between him and Daki. He demands they leave their geisha district as they all follow the rules, telling them a brawl isn't allowed and yelling they leave at once. Daki becomes annoyed at the man's commands and prepares to retaliate. Tanjiro sees this and forces the man back to prevent him from entering the attack's path, yelling for everyone to return to their homes. Daki unleashes a long-ranged Obi attack. Without warning, Daki's obi slice deep into the district, cutting buildings, slashing the ground and murdering civilians. Tanjiro is too slow to react and is cut deep in the shoulder, the man himself loses his hand to an obi slicing it off. Injured, Tanjiro can only watch in horror as the whole street crumbles to rubble and bystanders become horrified seeing the mangled corpses of innocents lives. Satisfied, Daki begins to walk away but Tanjiro calls out for her to come back and face him. Annoyed, she asks why he wants to continue confronting her, saying that the ugly don't deserve to live and telling him to die and rot together with them. The survivors try to comprehend the massacre before them, crying as they hold their dead loved ones and pulling the corpses free from the debris. The man weakly calls out, asking everyone to return inside. Tanjiro's rage. Daki's insults strike a nerve in Tanjiro, causing his eyes to grow bloodshot and making him seethe with intense rage. A few days previously, Shinjuro Rengoku wrote a letter addressed to Tanjiro, apologizing for his errors and thanking him for mourning Kyojuro's death. He apologizes for the way they first met and adding that Senjuro is now much better. He writes that his own incompetence was only the start of his downward spiral, as his wife Ruka's death had caused him even more anguish. Drinking himself into a stupor since then, he says there isn't a fool bigger than him. To him, Kyojuro is a fine son unlike himself. Abandoned, Kyojuro instead trained himself into a Hashira, despite only 3 volumes about Flame Breathing. Shinjuro comments he seemed to have more of Ruka's blood than his own and that Kyojuro and Senjuro are fine boys. He then writes that Tanjiro himself is even more impressive as he must be a Sun Breathing user, noting the mark on his head and that Sun Breathing users are born with such a mark. Tanjiro denies Shinjuro's words about his mark, as his scar came from protecting his brother from being burnt in an accident and an injury during Final Selection, his scar ending up looking the way it is now. He realizes his father was indeed born with a mark on his head but he himself isn't one of those few. Seeing the pain and devastation around him, Tanjiro mutters that despite the odds, there are moments when he cannot back down, as the world has those who lack human hearts and who kill without remorse; Tanjiro refuses to allow such a tyranny to exist and prepares to attack. Tanjiro grabs onto Daki's leg, poised to strike. As Daki begins to escape, Tanjiro leaps into the air and grabs her leg, preventing her from leaving. He tries to cut her head off but Daki dodges the swing, though he manages to rip off her foot. He furiously confronts her about the lost lives, saying they will never come back. As she heals her foot, Tanjiro demands she answer why they, the demons, kill the far weaker humans. Daki suddenly remembers hearing these exact words and a vision appears before her. Instead of Tanjiro, someone else appears, angrily asking what they found entertaining and amusing about taking lives. She realizes the memories are not her own but Muzan's, due to the memories of his cells inside her. Back in the cave, Makio and Suma tend over the unconscious victims, while Tengen ponders on their next move. Inosuke impatiently asks about what to do next, as the obi they were battling had just escaped. Tengen angrily demands he shut up as they have successfully saved everyone captured, telling Inosuke to worship and praise him. Makio instructs Tengen to go after the obi or more destruction might occur, with Suma adding they will be alright. Tengen then grabs Inosuke and Zenitsu in his arms, before leaping out the hold and demanding they follow him. The three run across the rooftops, with Tengen leading. He is far too fast however, and Inosuke and Zenitsu quickly lag behind the speeding Sound Hashira. Seeing the Demon Slayer's stare, Daki asks what is on Tanjiro's mind, to which he responds that she was once human too and have shed tears for pain and suffering. At this, she angrily punches the roof and blatantly says that she had forgotten her human memories. As demons don't grow old and need money to eat, they don't get sick and die, demons have nothing to lose. She angrily proclaims that demons can do whatever they want. Tanjiro quietly accepts her words and accelerates towards her. Tanjiro uses the Hinokami Kagura: Burning Bones, Summer Sun. She quickly uses her Blood Demon Art: Eight-Layered Obi Slash, ready to cut Tanjiro into pieces. Daki happily states that Tanjiro will die, as her obi is weaved and layered without escape and, with her being whole again with all her obi, she is far faster than before. Tanjiro suddenly uses Hinokami Kagura: Burning Bones, Summer Sun, slicing a fiery spiral into the incoming wave. She squeals in pain as she feels as if she's burning from the slash, then realizes she cannot regenerate as quickly, though she notes that with deeps wounds, Tanjiro's violent movements would normally rupture his body. Daki transmutes her neck into her Obi. Daki wonders how he was able to slash her in the beginning. Suddenly, she begins to tremble in fear, but realizes it is not her but Muzan who is terrified. Daki tries to overwhelm him again but Tanjiro is now able to rapidly slice and burn her obis. She leaps into the air and onto another house. Tanjiro chases her down and intercepts her incoming obi. He lands down and rushes towards Upper Six, before slicing her neck. As her head seemingly falls, she mocks him for believing he had decapitated her, her head revealed to be still attached by a sash onto her body. Tanjiro notices that with the sash being soft, it had blunted the slash. Daki resolves to prevent him from escaping, growing more obi. He believes that dodging them would create more havoc but becomes shocked at how slow they seem to be. He parries the obi successfully and manages to stab them all at once as they group up in one direction. Tanjiro annihilates Daki's obi.. Pinning them down, he pulls them taut as Daki mocks him for believing he can slice them before she takes control. Without warning, Tanjiro leaps into the air and frees them, before eviscerating the sashes before she could manipulate them and making his way to Daki, who is now too slow to react to his immense speed. As his sword nearly cuts into her neck, a vision of Hanako appears and desperately begs him to breathe. Before his blade can make contact, Tanjiro collapses before Daki in agony and struggles to breathe. Daki takes time to mock him for being human, saying they always struggle doing their best and feeling sorry for him. His visions begins to cloud, unable to see anything barely in front of him. Nezuko destroys Daki's head. As Daki prepares to decapitate the helpless Tanjiro, someone viciously kicks her head off and sending her body hurtling through the district. Nezuko appears, enraged at the attempt on her brother's life. Tanjiro coughs blood and his deep shoulder wound begins to bleed again. Memories of her family's death cloud Nezuko's mind, infuriating her even more. Daki becomes enraged at Nezuko destroying her head, realizing she is the one Muzan told her about. She recalls when Muzan has visited her in Yoshiwara. As she lies on his lap calmly, he mentions a demon had escaped him, like Tamayo. Muzan instructs her to find and kill the demon, describing her as a girl clad in a kimono patterned with leaves and wearing a checkered belt. Tanjiro eventually collapses from exhaustion. Nezuko prepares to battle her opponent as Daki answers Muzan's wishes to torture her to death. Nezuko charges ahead and tries to kick her again. Daki anticipates this, using her obi to slice off her right foot and left arm, before cutting deep into her torso and sending her flying into a house. Landing in front of the debris, she mocks Nezuko's weak regeneration, correctly believing she hasn't kill any humans. She instead declares she will stop bullying her for as they are both demon, planning to absorb her into her obi and leaving her in the sun to die. Nezuko emerges from the rubble with a new leg, stunning Daki as she notices her torso is also completely healed. Nezuko transforms. As she watches her arm grow back instantly, she realizes Nezuko's regeneration has reached that of an Upper Rank. Nezuko bites through her bamboo muzzle and enlarges herself for battle. Vines-like patterns emerge throughout her body and a horn grows on her head. Nezuko turns to face Upper Six, now emerging fully as a demon; Daki feels intimidated at her new appearance, with the aura of the battle suddenly changing. As an unconscious Tanjiro lies on the roof, he hears Takeo's voice. Takeo recalls that he and Nezuko are both similar, as they are both gentle but can get scary when angered. He recalls when Nezuko had confronted a rough-looking man for bumping a child, asking in his face to apologize and how scary it felt. He adds that people who get angry for the sake of others tend to overlook their own safety, and that they may lose something precious as a result. Nezuko speeds towards Daki and tries to kick her again. Daki mocks her for only being able to kick and slices her leg and arm off. At that moment, they grows back instantly and she slams her foot down onto Daki, driving her body into the ground. As Daki reels from the shock and pain of the impact, Nezuko stares menacingly at her. ","Categories: , , Episodes, , , , Season 2, , , , Entertainment District Arc"
40,Transformation,"After healing her leg, torso and left arm, Nezuko emerges from the rubble. She grows in size, attains vine-like patterns in her body and a horn on the right side of her head. She charges towards Daki, who instinctively cuts her leg and arm again. However, she heals instantly and slams her foot hard into the Upper Rank's back.","Nezuko beats down Daki. Reeling in pain from the impact, Daki struggles to understand how she healed so quickly, realizing too late that Nezuko's regeneration now exceeds her own as the new demon stomps off her left arm; hearing her scream, Nezuko smiles sadistically at Daki's pain. As Tanjiro lies unconscious from his clash with Daki, a vision of a tearful Takeo tries to get his brother to awaken, saying their sister won't be the same anymore, causing the Demon Slayer to quickly regain consciousness. Nezuko burns Daki with her Blood Demon Art, Exploding Blood. Nezuko breaks off Daki's other arm, causing her to scream in pain again, only for Nezuko to mercilessly continue her assault. Daki uses her obi to stave off Nezuko, slicing and decapitating her attacker. The Upper Rank backs away and sends her obi towards the young demon, who unexpectedly stops the attack while still not whole, using her congealed blood to maintain form and fight. Suddenly, Nezuko's splattered blood ignites, setting Daki alight. Remembering a horrific incident in her childhood, she screams in agony as she is roasted alive. Seeing this, Nezuko rejoins the pieces of herself and stares in delight at Daki's torment. Nezuko leaps into the air as her Blood Demon Art finishes, slamming her leg down onto the frightened Daki. She forces her down into the earth repeatedly, before kicking her down the road and chasing the hurtling demon with her new speed. Unable to do anything, Daki is forced to watch as Nezuko violently kicks her again, driving the helpless demon through several house with great force. Tanjiro restrains Nezuko with his sword. As she approaches her, Nezuko suddenly smells the blood of an injured bystander. As she tries to fight back the urge, her teeth chitter as she loses control and walks towards the wounded girl. She succumbs and moves forward to kill her when Tanjiro arrives in time, using his scabbard as a muzzle. Nezuko tries to fight her brother off, scratching him as he begs her to fight the urge and apologizes for forcing her into the battle. Sensing that Nezuko's blood is strewn around the area, Tanjiro realizes just how injured she is and asks her desperately to stop and sleep to heal. She gets down on all fours and leaps into an upper storey of the house with Tanjiro on her back. Still fighting the pain from his lack of breath using Hinokami Kagura, Tanjiro begs her to go to sleep. A horrifically burned Daki enters the scene, her healing still hampered by Nezuko's fire. With innocent lives nearby, Tanjiro is forced to choose between a rampant Nezuko and facing Daki. Tengen berating Tanjiro over Nezuko's transformation. When she uses her obi to attack him, Tengen emerges into the house and cuts them before they can hit. The Sound Hashira calmly asks if this is truly Nezuko, now ""a flashy demon"". When Tanjiro asks him for help, Tengen can only growl angrily at her new state, in spite of showing her resistance to humans in front of Kagaya and the Hashira. Daki asks if Tengen is here to fight her, but he only tells her to shut up and claims she isn't an Upper Rank. As she angrily retorts this, her head suddenly falls off, sliced in the neck by Tengen earlier. The duo looking for the Sound Hashira after losing sight of him. As Inosuke and Zenitsu stand alone on the rooftops, the former rants at losing sight of Tengen. Using his hearing, Zenitsu detects a distant explosion and runs towards it, while Inosuke follows suit. As Tanjiro stares in disbelief seeing Daki truly beheaded, Tengen reminds him the battle isn't over and instructs him to control Nezuko. As he half-heartedly suggest singing her a lullaby, she kicks into the floor and flings herself and Tanjiro outside. Realizing she isn't listening to him, he asks his mother for help and thinks of an idea. Still reining her in, Tanjiro sings a lullaby sung by their mother and holds her hand as she struggles. Nezuko suddenly sees herself not in Tanjiro's arms but her mother's. Kie sings the lullaby and the demon remembers a time when her family journeyed into the mountains. Nezuko returns to normal after remembering her mother's song. As they walk up the mountain, Nezuko asks about the song she sang, innocently wondering if her brother's eyes were red because her mother had eaten red berries while pregnant, causing Kie to smile brightly at her fun question. Nezuko begins to cry and eventually controls herself, becoming smaller and falling asleep; exhausted, Tanjiro tells their mother she's finally asleep. Preparing to walk away, Tengen hears Daki calling to him, saying he will pay for beheading him. Uninterested, Tengen tells her she is of no use to him and to die ""an unflashy death"". Daki tries to claim she is truly an Upper Rank demon, only for the Sound Hashira to condescendingly ask why she is holding her head. She tries to claim again she is Upper Six but Tengen doesn't listen. Insulted, Daki begins to cry and whines that she is Upper Six and she is amazing. Unable to believe he's witnessing a demon throw a tantrum, Tengen suddenly realizes she isn't disintegrating despite being beheaded. As she rants and pounds the floor in anger, Daki suddenly calls out for her ""brother"". A mysterious demon emerging from Daki's body. At that moment, something emerges from the stump of her neck and grows out her body. Tengen speeds forwards to decapitate the new threat but the demons vanish before his swords could reach. When Tengen turns around, he stares in horror at the sight of two demons; Daki's brother calms her crying and heals her burns instantly. Tengen attacks the new demon, blocking his blow but sustaining a cut to the head. As they face each other, the demon compliments his face, body and musculature. When he claims Tengen receives much attention from women, he claws himself in envy, telling him to die a horrendous death. Daki tells her brother there are more demon slayers, asking he kill Nezuko who burned her and claiming she tried to do her best but ""everyone got in my way and bullied me"". He calls hurting Daki unforgivable and prepares to exact his revenge, while threatening that Tengen will spin around as he dies, ""Because my name is Gyutaro"". Gyutaro hurls his Kamas towards Tengen, causing a large explosion and decimating the house. As Tanjiro watches from below, he sees the flying Kamas boomerang back inside and suddenly smells Tengen's blood. To his relief, Inosuke and Zenitsu emerge to assist. Taking Nezuko away, he instructs the two to enter the house and help the Hashira. Having stopped the attack with his blades, Gyutaro sees this and takes time to compliments Tengen as ""a good-looking guy"" and noting the frightened bystanders next to him must believe he is their saviour. At this, Tengen agrees and adds that he even has three wives. Gyutaro unleashes Blood Demon Art: Flying Blood Sickles. Infuriated, Gyutaro angrily calls this unforgivable and infuses his blood into his Kamas, before using Blood Demon Art: Flying Blood Sickles to slice him to pieces. Analyzing the razor thin blood blades, Tengen deploys bombs to blow the demons away and destroy the floor. The Hashira lands to the bottom and urges the civilians inside to flee. Seeing this, Gyutaro causes his blood blades to bend and chase after him, forcing Tengen to fend them off as they lock onto him. Upper Rank Six of the Twelve Kizuki As he fights, Tengen realizes then just how powerful the siblings are and wonders if perhaps they would both die if Gyutaro is beheaded instead. Through his hearing, he scans the house using echolocation and is relieved to see everyone has fled. He hurls more bombs into the air and uses his swords to direct and activate them, destroying the house and knocking Inosuke and Zenitsu to the ground. After the blast, Tengen jumps up to survey the damage and sees a ball of obi land unharmed. As he remarks this mission won't be easy, Daki unfurls her obi while Gyutaro states, ""The thing about us, is that we're two people in one!"".

41,Gathering,"Uzui battles furiously, taking on both Daki and the other demon who emerged from her body, Gyutaro. But he’s gradually losing strength, due to the poison from Gyutaro’s scythe. Just then, Inosuke, the sleeping Zenitsu, and Tanjiro, who’s managed to get Nezuko to sleep, all come rushing to Uzui’s aid...[1]","Running away with Nezuko asleep in his arms, Tanjiro takes her back to her box and whisper for her to sleep tight. Tying the torn strap into a knot, he declares he will fight to the end and carries her box again as he heads on out to fight. Gyutaro sarcastically compliments Tengen for his looks, three wives and confident swagger, further mentioning none of the Hashira he has killed are like him. The Demon makes the claim he was born special, cursing him for being chosen talent and hoping he will kill him quickly. Tengen shoots down his words and declares he isn't anyone special. He mocks Gyutaro and Daki for their lack of awareness living in Yoshiwara their whole lives and that they know nothing. Daki refuses to believe him but Tengen doesn't back down. Tengen says that he can never become like Kyojuro. He states that Japan is a vast country teeming with people that would fill you with awe; people like Gyomei who are complete enigmas, and people like Muichiro, who became a Hashira only two months after first holding a sword. Tengen angrily claims he isn't chosen like them and rhetorically asks how many lives has he let slip through his grasp; internally voicing he can never be like Kyojuro. Gyutaro asks why is he not special when he's still alive, as his Kamas are coated in poison, to which Tengen asserts he is a shinobi and has developed resistance to poison. Daki claims the shinobi were wiped out back in the Edo Era, to which he agrees. The Sound Hashira reminisces on his past; as a child he had nine brothers and sisters. Seven were killed when he was only 15, causing his aggressive father to subject the rest to brutal training. The only two survivors were him and his brother two years younger. He had treated his wives as expendables tools to produce heirs; Tengen vehemently refused to be him. Kagaya recognizes Tengen's efforts in a flashback. When he and his wives met with a young Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the master reflects on the difficult path they had chosen. The shinobi had all rejected the ideologies instilled in them in order to be Demon Slayers, and Kagaya can only question how hard it must be for them. Yet in the face of all this, they persist and continue to protect innocent lives. Kagaya warmly thanks him and calls him a ""remarkable child"". Tengen extending his attack range by holding onto the tip of his weapon. Remembering his words, Tengen declares that for Kagaya, he will always lay his life for him. Gyutaro watches as Tengen begins breathing harder and mocks him for acting tough when the poison is indeed working slowly. Tengen stabs the ground and exuberantly denies this, now fully excited to battle. He twirls his cleaver into Gyutaro, forcing him and Daki back. He separates the two by kicking Daki in the air and slashing at her brother. The two converge on Tengen, who hurls bombs. Though Gyutaro dodges them, Daki is blown away after hitting one, to which Gyutaro realizes they explode with little friction. Tengen swings at Gyutaro, using his fingertips to hold one edge to extend the other's range and slitting the Upper Rank's throat. Daki, realizing she's been beheaded again, angrily curses herself for always being the one hit. The trio arrives to the Sound Hashira's aid. Gyutaro claims Tengen he will fail in the end, as the poison will eventually kill him. At that moment, Inosuke and Zenitsu appear to assist him. Daki and Gyutaro stare in wonder at the two but are then joined by Tanjiro. Yoshiwara District is evacuated and everyone leaves, guided by Makio and Suma. Hinatsuru recovers from her ordeal and slowly makes her way out the Kirimise. Tengen applauds the trio for their ""flashy entrances"" while Gyutaro mocks them and claims they will all die anyway. Tanjiro realizes that Daki is indeed alive but Gyutaro is emitting a stronger demonic scent and must be the main unit of Upper Rank Six. Daki claims they can't win with the Hashira poisoned, to Tanjiro's horror. Tengen instead proclaims they will succeed and dares them not to underestimate humans, claiming the three are his brilliant Tsuguko. Tengen reveals he has identified that to kill them means simultaneous decapitation of both, his excitement and will reminding Tanjiro of Kyojuro, to his amazement. Gyutaro mocks their plan, as none of the Hashira they face had ever succeeded in beheading them; Gyutaro personally devouring fifteen and Daki having devoured seven. Zenitsu attacks Daki, launching her into the sky. Daki attacks Tengen without warning, but Zenitsu intercepts her obi and uses the energy of his attack to launch both of them out the house and into the sky. As Tanjiro calls out to him, Inosuke instructs him to ignore Zenitsu, as he and himself will take on Daki, leaving Tengen and Tanjiro with Gyutaro. Landing on the rooftops, Daki realizes he is the one she had struck. Zenitsu menacingly demands she apologize to the young girl she had hurt, claiming that the girls who helped her aren't her belongings. Daki refuses to hear his lecture and claims that in this city, women are merchandise; they are only here to be sold, bought and destroyed. Zenitsu tells her not to push her pain onto others; hearing this, Daki claims he is wrong and begins to speak with her and Gyutaro's voices together. Gyutaro implants his eye into Daki's forehead. As one, they state they hurt others and benefit from their debts, because they cannot make up for their own misfortune unless they collect it from the blessed. They claim it is their way of life, as Daki reveals Gyutaro's eye on her forehead; they've killed everyone who accused them and soon they will slash the throats of the Demon Slayers just like the others. Tanjiro cannot believe Gyutaro's bloodlust and tries to focus that he is now facing the true Upper Rank Six. Tanjiro plans to protect Tengen by moving as soon as the demon moves, only for Gyutaro to interrupt by speeding forward. He tries to stab Tanjiro in the jaw, but he dodges the blow, allowing Tengen to attack him, while Tanjiro berates himself for being too slow and hindering the battle. As Tengen and Gyutaro trade blows, they are intercepted by Daki's obi punching into the house. With his eye in her, Daki and Gyutaro begin to work as one and sync their attack to fend off all four Demon Slayers. The obi are blocked by Tanjiro but he struggles with the sheer number of them. Having joined Zenitsu, Inosuke hears Daki claim she is now at her true power, to which he tells her to be shut up for her shrill voice. Daki and Gyutaro fight as one. Gyutaro watches Tengen and Tanjiro struggle with the obi, while Daki uses more to attack her assailants. Inosuke and Zenitsu parry them away, to which Inosuke claims if she wanted to prove her strength, she can try to kill them. Daki happily obliges and attacks with even more ferocity. With the sheer number of attacks overwhelming the Demon Slayers, the separate confrontations become one giant battle. Tengen is forced to dodge both the obi and Gyutaro's Kamas, using his bombs to free himself from the onslaught. Tengen clashes with Gyutaro. Gyutaro engages him again and quickly overwhelms him with his Praying Mantis-like fighting style, causing Tengen to sustain several cuts. Using Blood Demon Art: Flying Blood Sickles, Gyutaro launches blood blades and they fly backwards to slice Tengen, but Tanjiro blocks them from hitting him. As he struggles with the weight of the blades, he remembers that Water Breathing's flexibility is better defensively and parries the blades away from him, freeing Tengen to attack. The Sound Hashira then retaliates with Sound Breathing, Fifth Form: String Performance, destroying the blades and sending Gyutaro into the streets away from the house; Gyutaro mocks his efforts and decides to assist Daki with more blood blades. Zenitsu and Inosuke clashing with Daki. With Zenitsu and Inosuke now forced to avoid the blades and obi, the two struggle to get close to Daki; Inosuke adds that he can sense the blood blades are extremely deadly. Tanjiro joins Tengen and Gyutaro's clash by stabbing the obi into the ground. Tengen watches as Tanjiro continues to fight despite his deep shoulder wound, realizing he may not continue for longer. Tanjiro realizes he is losing breath again and switches to Recovery Breathing. Watching Tengen and Gyutaro battle from above, Hinatsuru arrives with a kunai volley crossbow. She fires the hail of knives at Gyutaro, but he blocks them with Blood Demon Art: Rampant Arc Rampage. Amused that some had even stuck into Tengen, he is shocked to see him continue to charge forward and slice both his legs. Gyutaro impressed by Tanjiro's focus. Gyutaro is then hit by another kunai in the neck and he soon realizes they are laced with something wisteria-based, since his legs aren't regenerating. Using Tengen's attack, Tanjiro sees his chance and rushes in, swinging his sword into Gyutaro's neck, as the Upper Rank commends him for regaining focus in a short time. ","In the anime, while avoiding Daki's obi, Inosuke taunts her into attacking with her full strength, leading her to launch even more obis at them; these then punch into the house and stall Tengen and Tanjiro's attempts at attacking Gyutaro. This sequence is not in the manga., Gyutaro succeeds in cutting and poisoning Tengen twice more in the anime."
42,Defeating an Upper Rank Demon,"Hinatsuru’s use of wisteria poison leaves Gyutaro momentarily vulnerable, but Tanjiro and Uzui’s attacks fall just short. Using his Blood Demon Art, Gyutaro vanishes from Uzui’s sight only to reappear assaulting Hinatsuru. Tanjiro and Uzui attempt to save her, but they are thwarted by Daki’s Belt.[1]","Deflecting the wave of kunais, Gyutaro watches as Tengen ducks down his swing and slices off both his legs. Struck by a stray kunai laced with wisteria poison, he is unable to heal. Tanjiro and Tengen seize their moment and swing their blades at his neck, as Hinatsuru watches from above. Tengen and his wives visiting the Uzui Family Grave. In a past visit to Tengen's family grave, he and his wives pray for them. Tengen, lamenting that he is unable to ever drink with them, pours sake on the headstone and says they can all drink together one day. All four shinobi then sit down for lunch. As he eats, Hinatsuru asks if Tengen still has his siblings in mind. He answers that not a day goes by where he doesn't recall them and it seems only recently that he left his home with his wives. As she, Suma and Makio stare in wonder at his remark, Tengen asks they eat as well. Suma loudly exclaims about the delicious food, causing Makio to berate her despite Tengen's words to ""dig in"". As the girls eat, Tengen mutters that he'll go to hell someday, much to their shock. He takes back his words but reminds them they do not need to berate him again. He stares at the headstone and claims he will live ""the flashiest life possible... for my siblings' sake"" with them. A sudden gust of wind arrives, blowing sakura flower petals from the trees. Tengen gently picks a petal of Hinatsuru's head, causing her to blush. When Makio asks for the same treatment, she is denied and told she put the petals there herself, to her chagrin. Hinatsuru asks for the petal from him, clutching it gently in her hands and thanking him warmly. Suma and Makio see this and asks for a petal from Tengen as well; he remarks they can grab one themselves, causing them to exasperatedly call him cruel, to Hinatsuru's subtle laughter. Hinatsuru watches as Tanjiro and Tengen close in on the Upper Rank. Gyutaro forces the kunai out his neck and regenerates his legs. The Sound Hashira realizes the wisteria poison has already been neutralized. Gyutaro remarks this poison will pack a punch and seeps blood from his arms. Constant Resounding Slashes vs Rotating Circular Slashes - Flying Blood Sickles. Using Blood Demon Art, Rotating Circular Slashes: Flying Blood Sickles, he spins the blood blades around his kamas. Tanjiro narrowly misses the spinning blades, destroying his uniform sleeve; Tengen retaliates with Sound Breathing, Fourth Form: Constant Resounding Slashes, rapidly twirling his swords and dispersing the blood blades. Seeing Gyutaro has vanished, he hears Hinatsuru call to him and sees Daki's incoming obi. As the obi nearly wraps around him, Hinatsuru hurls a kunai at the sash and tells Tengen she will lure them to herself alone. At that moment, Gyutaro appears behind her and wraps his hand around her mouth; Tengen tries to save her but the obi block his path and encircle around him. Seeing his wife in danger causes Tengen to relieve another memory; when he was at a sunset-lit field with his wives. Suma watches the dragonflies in the sky and remarks she would like to be one. Tengen says that is a flashy dream, only for Makio to interrupt their chat and berate Suma for her silliness. As Suma denies her words and tells Makio she hates her, an amused Tengen and Hinatsuru watch their bickering, causing her to laugh subtly. ""But no hard feelings, all right?"" Hinatsuru asks Tengen about them living as ordinary people after he defeats an Upper Rank; she adds that as they were raised as shinobi, they still need to atone for the murders they had committed or live with the regret. She remarks that the day it happens, none of them may be alive and she gently asks him not to take her words too hard. Tanjiro combines Hinokami Kagura with Water Breathing. Remembering her words, Tengen angrily rips the obi apart and yells for Hinatsuru to be left alone. His pleas startle Tanjiro and he sees Hinatsuru in Gyutaro's grasp. Unwilling to lose another innocent life , he forces himself to run towards her, despite his severe wounds and exhausted state. Telling himself to stop always being the one to be saved, Tanjiro realizes that Gyutaro doesn't see him as a threat because he is weak and a surprise attack could save Hinatsuru. He fends off incoming obis and comments he can reach her quickly with Hinokami Kagura. As he tries to breathe the style again, it hurts him greatly and he feels he has lost all his stamina. Thinking quickly, he combines Water Breathing and Hinokami Kagura in an immense burst of speed, slices off Gyutaro's hand and saving Hinatsuru. Gyutaro is stunned by the lightning-fast move and but sees the exhausted Tanjiro, believing he can no longer move like that. Tanjiro commends himself for blending the two styles and the higher attack power over normal Water Breathing. He comments that the best swordsmen only became great after they thought long and hard and found the style that best suited them. He remembers he was taught by Sakonji Urokodaki to modify the style into any form, and though he can never master it like Giyu Tomioka, he resolves to not let the lessons go to waste. Gyutaro leaps at Tanjiro and prepares to kill him, blocking his sword with his left kama and attacking with the right. Tengen appears suddenly and exclaims Tanjiro has his gratitude, as he swings his sword into Gyutaro's neck. Elsewhere, Inosuke and Zenitsu struggle with the sheer amount of obis to look out for. Inosuke becomes intensely annoyed that he is also unable to attack them directly, with the obi being too slithery and hard to cut. Launched into the sky by Daki, he panics seeing Tengen about to make contact with Gyutaro; Zenitsu warns him of an incoming obi and he narrowly dodges it. Zenitsu explains his plan to Inosuke. Realizing they would need to get to Daki and cut her head off too, an angered Inosuke begins to charge towards her, erratically swatting the obis away. Regardless, he is forced back again and Zenitsu tells him to calm down, for they still need to attack despite Tengen and Tanjiro beheading Gyutaro, causing Inosuke to exclaim about his friend's sudden seriousness. Gyutaro holds down Tanjiro's and Tengen's blades. Tanjiro swings his sword together with Tengen but Upper Rank Six blocks the blades with his kama, mocking them for believing they could behead him. Flesh from the kamas attaches to their blades and the two are unable to free them. Using his second blade, Tengen tries to behead him again but Gyutaro twists his head around and bites down onto it. With the two locked in place, Gyutaro seeps more blood again into another wave of Rotating Circular Slashes. As Tanjiro and Hinatsuru brace for impact, Tengen pulls himself and Gyutaro away from them, sending the two to the ground, where the blood blades burst and nearly hit Tanjiro and Hinatsuru. With Tengen fighting the demon alone, they call out to him but are suddenly warned by Inosuke as the obi now converges on them. He and Zenitsu fends them off while the two fall back. Tengen battles Gyutaro alone. With Inosuke incensed that the obi is forcing them to change tactics, Zenitsu reminds them that Daki is still weaker than Gyutaro and they can behead her. Asking if Tanjiro can still move, he is answered when Tanjiro escapes being cocooned again with his Water Breathing. Suddenly, blood blades fly and nearly hit him, making Tanjiro realize that Gyutaro is still actively attacking him while fighting Tengen. Hinatsuru retreats to safety, while Daki happily notes that their movements are now slower. Inosuke laments that with Tengen and Tanjiro both badly wounded, it's up to him and Zenitsu; remembering all their training since Kyojuro's death, he angrily states it was all for nothing. Tanjiro tells him it will take incredible speed to take down Daki and they would need to slash her from multiple directions or risk failing. Watching as the obi closes around Tanjiro, Inosuke sees the attack is seemingly slowing down as well. Reinvigorated, Inosuke leaps into the sky and deflects all the obi around him. As he exclaims it is up to him being the dual wielder to attack in multiple direction, he states the three of them will beat her. Tanjiro acknowledges the plan and informs Zenitsu they will both protect Inosuke from the obis. Daki hears their plan and denies that adding one more ""ugly freak"" would mean they could beat her. She launches even more obis towards the trio, sending them back. As Tanjiro calls out to Inosuke, he tells his ""underlings"" not to be late, as he prepares to lead the attack. The trio combines their techniques. With the obis deflected by his friends and his path freed, Inosuke breathes harder, strengthens his body and uses Beast Breathing, Eighth Fang: Explosive Rush. As he speeds towards the obi demon, he is saved from getting slashed by Tanjiro and Zenitsu flanking his sides. Charging behind Inosuke, Tanjiro uses Water Breathing, Third Form: Flowing Dance, while Zenitsu simultaneously uses Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunder Clap and Flash, Eightfold; together, the two eviscerate all the obis in Inosuke's path. He continues the charge to his target and ignores sustaining multiple cuts to focus on his goal. Inosuke beheads Daki with Sixth Fang: Palisade Bite. Unable to hit him moving too quickly, Daki is forced to watch as Inosuke swings both his swords into her neck. As she tells him there's no way he can behead her, Inosuke uses Sixth Fang: Palisade Bite, sawing the chipped blades and decapitating Daki. As her head falls, Inosuke catches it and sprints away to prevent her from reattaching it to her body. When the obi chase him, Tanjiro and Zenitsu parry them away from him, while Inosuke instructs them to help Tengen. As he runs away with Daki's severed head, she demands he let her go and tries to grab the Demon Slayer with her hair. He slashes them away and calls her attacks lame, infuriating her. Gyutaro stabs Inosuke from behind. Without warning, Gyutaro appears and stabs him through the chest from behind with his kama, retrieving his sister's head in the process. As a shocked Tanjiro watches from afar, he realizes Inosuke is now both wounded and poisoned. Wondering how Gyutaro managed to reach him, he looks around for the Sound Hashira, and he stares in horror at the sight of Tengen's severed left hand and unconscious body. Tanjiro apologizes to his friends for their defeat. Too slow to react, Tanjiro hears Zenitsu suddenly calls out to him as the area begins to glow brightly. Daki's obi slashes into the surrounding houses as Zenitsu pushes Tanjiro away from the attack's path. Tanjiro tells his friend to forget about him, as he laments his lack of focus has led to Inosuke and Tengen both getting mortally wounded, apologizing to everyone and Nezuko. ","When Tengen remembers his intentions to retire with his wives, the anime shows them in an open field with trees behind Hinatsuru and Makio. In the manga, it is bamboo behind them instead., Zenitsu is almost encircled by Daki's obi till he frees himself. This is not shown in the manga., In the anime, the scene of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke attacking Daki has been extended;, Inosuke is shown to cause an explosion with the impact of his feet while using Explosive Rush., Tanjiro uses Flowing Dance to begin fending away the obi as he gets close to lead in front of Inosuke., Zenitsu is shown attacking the obi twice before the eight strikes of Thunderclap and Flash, Eightfold., He and Tanjiro lead in front of Inosuke to clear his path from most of the obi., Inosuke is seen ignoring several cuts to reach Daki."
43,Never Give Up,"Tanjiro and Uzui have been separated by Gyutaro’s Blood Demon Art. As Tanjiro joins the struggling Zenitsu and Inosuke, they manage to decapitate Daki at last thanks to their coordinated barrage of sword strikes. However, when Inosuke tries to run off with Daki’s head, he gets pierced by Gyutaro’s scythe. Uzui has also collapsed, leaving Tanjiro and the others with their backs to the wall.[1]","After seeing Tengen's unconscious body and severed left hand, Tanjiro freezes in shock and disbelief. Zenitsu warns him of an incoming attack and pushes him off the roof, as the obi rips apart their surroundings. Tanjiro apologizes to everyone for his lack of concentration getting everyone hurt, including Nezuko. Nezuko begs Tanjiro to stop apologizing for everything unfortunate. Tanjiro lands hard on the ground and apologizes again for his mistakes. Drifting out of consciousness, he sees himself back in his home's forest with Nezuko before him, as she appears before her transformation. She begs him not to apologize and asks why he keeps doing so. She reminds him their father had died of his illness but it wasn't his fault. Being human, they can never expect everything to go their way and reminds him what is most important is the now. Transforming back into her demon appearance, she asks that they fight harder and urges him to stop blaming himself, while crying out that she wants him to understand how she feels. Gyutaro surprised that Tanjiro is still alive. Tanjiro reawakens and witnesses Yoshiwara District in flames; seeing the devastation, he can't help but ask if the people living here are fine. He turns back to see Nezuko and is relieved to see her still asleep. As he reaffirms he must do what he can, Gyutaro appears before him, wondering how he is still alive. Upper Rank Six mocks him for his luck, seeing it as the only thing he has going for him, as Daki contently watches them from the rooftops. Gyutaro says he pities him for being the only survivor and tells him of his friends' fates. Inosuke lies motionless in a pool of his blood, Zenitsu is trapped underneath rubble and struggling to escape and he mocks Tengen for being weak and dying to his poison while acting proud. Gyutaro calls the four of them disgraceful, making special emphasis on him for carrying around a demon on his back and asking who she is. Terrified, Tanjiro can only wonder why Gyutaro isn't killing him yet, while realizing he still doesn't have the strength to attack. He gives in to his question and tells the demon that Nezuko is his younger sister. At this, Gyutaro laughs and says he is disgraceful again for not protecting her. Sticking his kamas into the ground, he kneels down to his level and says it's because she is a demon and he is a human. Gyutaro demands that Tanjiro try to behead him. He scornfully pats Tanjiro's head and says it's his job to protect her, not be protected. He grabs Tanjiro's hand and sadistically breaks two fingers; as he reels in pain, Gyutaro laughs at his suffering and demands he listen to him. He viciously grabs Tanjiro's head and insults him repeatedly for being the disgraceful sole survivor and his weakness. Unarmed, he goads Tanjiro into killing him. Gyutaro calls Tanjiro a disgrace. Released from his hold, Tanjiro takes Nezuko's box and runs away from him, while he and Daki watch dumbfounded. Gyutaro laughs at his crushed spirit and chases him down, before violently kicking him into a burning house. He escapes before the burning rubble can crush him and feebly tries to flee. Gyutaro walks towards him and insults him again for being disgraceful. Tanjiro desperately throws sachets and rubble at him, only for the demon to kick him in the stomach, causing him to vomit blood. Gyutaro states how despite his weakness, he doesn't dislike him, as he likes anything disgraceful, filthy and pathetic. He touches Tanjiro's scar and admires its weird appearance. Gyutaro suddenly has an idea and believes he should be a demon too, saying he will spare Tanjiro if he transforms and threatening to kill Nezuko if he refuses. Daki overhears him and rejects his idea. Tanjiro looks into the sky and claims he has been waiting for this moment. He headbutts Upper Six in the face; Gyutaro mocks him for his weak attempt to attack but is unexpectedly unable to stand up. He sees to his horror that Tanjiro had simultaneously stabbed him with a wisteria-laced kunai. Gyutaro suddenly realizes that Tanjiro had been leading him all along, running away to find the kunai and scattering a courtesan's sachets to mask the wisteria's scent. Tanjiro sees himself and Nezuko in Daki and Gyutaro. Gyutaro witnesses Tanjiro about to strike, cursing him for not giving up despite being so injured and weak compared to him. As he uses Hinokami Kagura once more, Tanjiro's blade ignites in fire and he brings his sword down into Gyutaro's neck. Tanjiro then hears what he initially believes to be Nezuko calling out to him, only to realize it is actually Daki calling out for Gyutaro. He envisions himself in Gyutaro's place and wonders what he could have been if he hadn't remained a human with Nezuko. Imagining himself as a demon, Tanjiro believes that someone in the Demon Slayer Corps would have the mercy to kill him. Fighting the pain, the Upper Rank attempts to grab his kama and pull the kunai out, while the blade begins to cut into his neck. Daki sees her brother in danger and sends her obi to kill Tanjiro. At that moment, Zenitsu pulls himself out the rubble with his Thunder Breathing and destroys the obi. Seeing him again, she angrily sends the obi his way instead to kill him. Zenitsu dodges them and prepares to attack, while Daki mentions how she now knows how fast he can attack, seeing it so many times. Thunderclap and Flash, Godspeed. Instead, he uses Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash, Godspeed. He instantly reaches Daki and catches her neck in his blade. Too stunned to react to his new speed, Daki hears the obi in her neck getting ripped by the blade. Gyutaro pulls out the kunai and recovers instantly, seeping blood blades to removing the sword from his neck. Tengen intercepts Gyutaro's attack, saving Tanjiro. Tanjiro fends them off but is viciously attacked by Gyutaro, the two racing across the district with Tanjiro forced on the defensive. As they clash, Gyutaro quickly breaks down the poison and fully recovers. Tanjiro realizes his attacks are speeding up and he forces himself to not give up, as the demon prepares to stab him in the eye. Without warning, Tengen appears and stops the kama from reaching him. Shocked to see the Hashira still alive, he realizes Tengen had forced his heart to stop, temporarily stopping the poison's circulation. Tengen, still skilled with one hand at using his blades, declares to a stunned Tanjiro that he can now use his Musical Score Technique and that they will win. Gyutaro sends a giant wave of blood blades to kill Tengen, but the Sound Hashira uses his enhanced hearing to see the attack as a song he can read, skillfully destroying the flying blades with his Sound Breathing and bombs. Tengen and Gyutaro clashing at high speeds. Tengen reaches the Upper Rank and slams down his swords in the ground, narrowly missing him. Gyutaro realizes that he turned his Rotating Circular Slashes into a song he can deflect, intensely angered he did so with one arm. The two clash head-on in a giant explosion and continue to attack each other, hurling themselves across the burning city doing so. They repeatedly trade violent blows across the district, speeding up while doing so and attacking so viciously, the city is engulfed in explosions and blood. With his Hinokami Kagura, Tanjiro catches up to the two but realizes that Tengen will reach his limit first, and he steels himself to be ready and decapitate Gyutaro. The Upper Rank stabs the Sound Hashira in the stomach and slashes upwards, cutting Tengen's left eye in half. The Hashira ignores the pain and stabs Gyutaro in the stomach, holding him in place as the two hurtle across the city. Tanjiro leaps up from behind and lunges towards them. Tanjiro persists to decapitate Gyutaro. Gyutaro mocks Tanjiro for being too slow and stabs him in the jaw, saying he is still a loser despite Tengen's assistance and he will eventually die to the poison. Tanjiro fights the pain and successfully brings his blade down on his neck. Using the last remains for his power, Tanjiro forces himself to fight even harder, the scar on his head becoming a fiery mark. With his new strength, he cuts deeper into Upper Six's neck, who curses himself for being decapitated by a ""brat"" like him. Gyutaro then realizes he can still survive if Daki's head remains in intact. Inosuke joins the fray. Elsewhere, Zenitsu, with Daki in his grasp, races across the skies, still using his Godspeed's energy to try and behead her. He realizes he no longer has any strength left, while Daki attempts to kill him from behind using her obi. Attacking Zenitsu behind his back, the obi is suddenly destroyed by Inosuke. Surprised to see him still alive despite Gyutaro stabbing him in the chest, Inosuke responds by saying that shifting his organs is easy for him, and that growing up in the mountainside means he cannot be poisoned. Inosuke brings his blades down onto her neck, as Daki desperately begs for her brother to do something. Realizing he needs to fend them off, Gyutaro tries to summon another wave of Rotating Circular Slashes. The trio defeats the Upper Ranks. With the last of their power left in their swords, Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke successfully decapitate Gyutaro and Daki simultaneously. The two demons' head bounce on the ground and unexpectedly stop in front of each other. Suma, Makio and Hinatsuru watch from the roof tops, Suma in disbelief at how they managed to defeat them both. Despite this, Hinatsuru is racked with uncertainty at the situation. With the poison affecting him, Tanjiro's vision blurs and his hearing weakens, and he fails to hear Tengen warning him that the battle isn't over. The Hashira desperate urges him to run but Gyutaro's body suddenly erupts into a giant explosion of blood blades, catching the Demon Slayers in the epicentre and devastating Yoshiwara. ","Gyutaro appears before Tanjiro immediately after he regains consciousness in the manga.

When this fails, the two meet face to face and trade blows at increasingly high speeds across the district. Gyutaro is also seen imbedding a kama into Tengen's blade chain to break the weapon into two pieces., The manga has Gyutaro's final attack as an enormous wave of blood blades, flying in multiple directions, whereas the anime depicts this as a titanic explosion destroying the district."
44,No Matter How Many Lives,"As the fierce battle draws to an end, Tanjiro and Uzui behead Gyutaro just as Zenitsu and Inosuke behead Daki. But then, Gyutaro unleashes a devastating Blood Demon Art, burying the city in rubble. When Tanjiro awakens, he joins Nezuko and Zenitsu, only to find Inosuke and Uzui on the brink of death from Gyutaro’s poison...[1]","In a combined monumental effort, Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke successfully decapitate Daki and Gyutaro; the dual holders of Upper Rank Six. In the wake of the battle, Tengen struggles to breathe and compose himself as the poison begins to take its toll. He sees that Gyutaro's body is preparing to spawn blood blades and warns Tanjiro, but the Demon Slayer is unable to respond due to the poison affecting him too. Tengen yells for him to run but the body erupts with enormous waves of blood, tearing apart the district. With her box thrown in the air, Nezuko emerges and uses her Blood Demon Art to burn the blades away, saving everyone. The aftermath of the battle. Tanjiro regains consciousness to see Nezuko beside him, and turns around to see the what remains of Yoshiwara District around them, now a pile of burnt rubble and debris. She pushes her head to his side, as he realizes that she had saved him from the poison. He quickly wonders on the whereabouts on the others; when he tries to stand, his legs immediately give out. He suddenly hears Zenitsu call out; at this, Nezuko carries Tanjiro on her back to take him to help. Zenitsu, now awake and panicking over the state of his injured body, sees his friend and worriedly asks if his legs are broken. When Tanjiro assures him he is more or less fine, Zenitsu informs him that Inosuke's heartbeat is getting fainter. Seeing his unconscious body, Tanjiro quickly assesses that the poison needs to be neutralized. He tries to think that sunlight could work to save him, but the moon's shine quickly shuts down his idea. He thinks about sending a crow to inform Shinobu but worries it would be too late. He begins to tear up at the idea of his friend's death, lamenting that he was spared. Nezuko burns away the poison. Suddenly, Nezuko touches Inosuke's chest and engulfs his body in her fire. To his amazement, Tanjiro sees the poison being burn away. Inosuke awakens and asks for something to eat, causing Tanjiro to cry and hug him in relief, much to his friend's bewilderment. Elsewhere, Suma cries out over Tengen's waning life, unable to stop the poison affecting him with their antidote. Makio and Hinatsuru sit beside him in shock, seeing their husband dying. Tengen tries to give them his last words but is drowned out by Suma's loud wailing, causing Makio to angrily scold her and for Hinatsuru to yell at the two to be quiet. Now annoyed, Tengen wonders if he will ever say his last words, just as Nezuko approaches them. She touches Tengen's arm and surrounds his body in her Blood Demon Art's fire, causing his wives to be intensely startled at the sight. Suma grabs Nezuko and furiously reprimands her for cremating him too early. Now healed, the Hashira arises and is relieved to feel the poison no longer inside him, causing the three girls to throw themselves on to him in utter relief. As they cry, he apologizes for worrying them. Tanjiro answers that Nezuko's Blood Demon Art had burned the poison away, though he urges Tengen to stay still. Tengen notes that he himself needs to be still with his wounds, but Tanjiro instead informs him he will look for the demons' heads. Carried by Nezuko around the burnt remains of the district, Tanjiro detects a pool of Gyutaro's blood and cautiously approaches it. Throwing a pebble into it to make it splash, he surmises that the blood is now inactive and takes a vial. Tamayo's cat emerges from the rubble, takes the sample and disappears to return to her. Tanjiro detects the scent of blood getting stronger and soon hears the Upper Rank siblings arguing with each other. Daki and Gyutaro argue. Gyutaro berates her for dying to the two ""bottom-feeders"" while Daki insults him for his failure to kill the Hashira. He retorts that he was aiming to kill ""the kid with the earrings"" first and tells her she could have been the one to kill Tengen. Daki retaliates by saying that he could have controlled her to do so but let his guard down and did nothing. Gyutaro insults his sister for claiming to be an Upper Rank and for not killing Zenitsu and Inosuke, calling her an idiot for her failure, as Tanjiro sees the two about to disintegrate while still fighting each other. Daki calls him the true idiot and responds that no one as ugly as him could be her brother, tearing as while doing so. Tanjiro and Gyutaro are shocked upon hearing her words but she continues, insisting they were never siblings to begin with. She states that his strength is his only saving grace and says he has no value when he dies, calling him a worthless, ugly freak. Tanjiro intervenes. He seethes with rage at her insults and tears into her by claiming she would have been long dead without him, calling her the true worthless one and insisting that she too knows it. As she hears his response, Gyutaro wishes he had never protected her at all and he curses her for causing his life to be what it is now. Daki begins to cry and Tanjiro runs over to the siblings. As he laments always cleaning up her messes, Tanjiro gently closes his mouth when he wishes she had never been born, claiming it to be a lie. Tanjiro insists that all he said was untrue and urges Gyutaro to get along with Daki before dying. He tells the Upper Rank siblings that with all they have done, they will be despised and resented by all in the world without anyone but themselves, lamenting that they shouldn't be cursing each other in their final moments. Daki wails at his message and insists that Tanjiro shouldn't be lecturing them; she becomes scared at her fate and begs her brother to fix the situation before disintegrating completely. Gyutaro sees her disappear and calls out her name, ""Ume"". Gyutaro remembers it as her original human name and curses her demon name Daki, though he also insists that Ume was a terrible name too, being the disease that killed their mother. Gyutaro being bullied for being ugly. Gyutaro reminisces on their past. He was born into the Rashomon Riverbanks, the lowest caste of the Entertainment District. Children were considered curses then, since they were looked at as just extra mouths to feed; because of this, his mother attempted to kill him several times over his existence. Born with a frail body, he nonetheless managed to survive, though he was berated and insulted over his appearance, uncleanliness and voice. He was especially despised for living in the Entertainment District, since beauty was a measure of value. When hungry, he devoured mice and insects, and his favourite toy was a customer's forgotten sickle. ""You were my pride and joy"" His life changed when Ume was born. Gyutaro considered her his pride and joy, as her great beauty caused even grown ups to be stunned. He discovered he was skilled at combat and used it in his work as a debt collector, along with his sickle. His appearance and horrid reputation instilled fear throughout the district, causing him to embrace his ugliness; and he was especially proud of Ume's beauty and believed it removed his sense of inferiority. As Gyutaro felt that their life was getting better, that good feeling disappeared when Ume turned thirteen. As he walked about the district, he discovers Ume's charred body lying in a ditch to his utter horror. She had attacked a customer of hers, a samurai, and blinded him by stabbing his eye with her hair pin. In retaliation, she was bound and burnt alive by the man; Gyutaro only happened upon her body while returning from his work. When she struggles to breathe, Gyutaro realizes she is still alive. He tearfully grabs her body and yells for no one to get what he owns. He curses the man who took her sister and yells for Ume to be turned back to normal. Gyutaro angrily threatens to kill the gods but is suddenly sliced across the back. As he collapses, the samurai from earlier is revealed to be the one who attacked him. He is accompanied by Ume's madam, who thanks him for killing Gyutaro, since he was troublesome throughout the district, unaware that Gyutaro is still alive and hearing her words. She laments that Ume is gone but offers another pretty girl as a reward. The samurai pauses and insists on finishing off the two, only for Gyutaro to leap into the air and stab the woman in the face with his sickle, killing her instantly. Gyutaro splits the head of the samurai in half. Shocked to see him still alive, the samurai hears Gyutaro menacingly compliments him on his kimono and skin complexion. He guesses that he eats plenty and has a nice, clean bed to sleep in. He believes that good things is all he knows, even a house to protect him from the weather, angrily calling him lucky. As the samurai takes a stance, Gyutaro states that someone as well of as him shouldn't be one to complain over a lost eye; the man charges towards Gyutaro but the boy slices his face in half in retaliation. Upper Rank Six finds the siblings near death. Gyutaro carries Ume's body throughout the district, but his efforts are in vain as no one offers them help. He collapses from exhaustion, still carrying his sister in her arms as snow begins to fall on the city. He grieves over the needed help they were never given no matter the situation, cursing the belief that ""fortune and misfortune are intertwined"" over their continual miserable existence. Without warning, the siblings are happened upon by the Upper Rank Six of then, who had been wandering about the district while eating his meal. Calling himself ""kind hearted"" and believing that Ume will die soon, the demon offers to give the two his blood and transform them. Furthermore, he believes that if ""he"" accepts them, they can be demons as well. Dropping the head he was eating, he asks whether they can become a Twelve Kizuki and rise up like him. ""My only regret. I guess it was you"" Gyutaro reflects on the demon's words and his eventual transformation, insisting he doesn't regret being one. He believes that no matter how many times he is reborn, he will always be a demon. Despite his proudness in being ""the Gyutaro who collects"", he has one underlying regret: Ume. He laments over what her life could have been had she been born differently. Had she worked in a better house, she could have been a well-known Oiran. If she was born to normal parents, she could have been a normal girl. Had she been born to a good family, she could have been a respectable young woman. He believes that with her impressionable and pliant personality, he unknowingly shaped her into what she became in the end. Gyutaro admits that his teachings even led to her attacking the samurai, since she could have turned out better had she ignored what she was taught by him. He believes that his only regret in life is her. The Upper Rank sees himself in a dense, foggy void, believing it to be Hell. Wondering at his situation, Ume calls out to him and comments that she hates it here. Gyutaro realizes that though he retains his demonic appearance, Ume has reverted to her looks before she was burned. He turns to walk away from her, causing Ume to ask if he is heading to the exit. Hearing this, Gyutaro urges her to stop following him; when she tries to ignore his words, he angrily repeats them. As he walks away, Ume believes he is angry at her final words before she died and urges him to forgive her, taking back her insults and insisting she was only upset over their defeat. She apologizes for not fighting hard enough, believe they could have won had she been more useful and apologizing for always bring the two of them down. Urging him to listen, Gyutaro instead responds by saying they are no longer siblings, insisting he walk his path while she will walk to the light away from him. Ume refuses to leave Gyutaro. Instead of listening, Ume tearfully clings to her brother and refuses to leave him, exclaiming that no matter how many times she is reborn, she will always be his little sister. She cries while urging him not to hate her, asking him never to leave her alone and refusing to forgive him if he does so, ""Because we're always going to be together"". Ume reiterates a promise he had made as they were young, causing Gyutaro to remember that moment again. With just each other, he had insisted that they can't be beaten together and promising they will always be together. As she cries, Gyutaro lifts her legs up, and, changing back into his human appearance, the two enter the fires of Hell together. Tanjiro and Nezuko watch as the last remnants of Gyutaro's head fade into ash; he wonders whether the siblings had made up. Obanai arrives in the wake of the battle. Arriving in Yoshiwara, Obanai Iguro commends Tengen for defeating Upper Six, though he makes emphasis that he has only killed the weakest Upper Rank. Tengen denies his words but Suma angrily confront him for being late, causing Obanai's snake to hiss at her. The Serpent Hashira asks what he will do now that he's lost his left eye and hand, wondering if he can recover and return to his duty. To this, Tengen announces that he will retire from being a Hashira, believing that Kagaya will accept his choice. Obanai angrily refuses to listen to his wish, retorting that too many new Demon Slayers are dying without reaching their potential and claiming that having someone ""as uninspiring as you"" is still better than nothing. Unsatisfied with his decision, he urges the Sound Hashira to battle till he dies. Tengen ignores him and retorts his earlier statement, stating that ""the young guy you hate"" is reaching his potential. Hearing this, Obanai becomes stunned, unable to believe that Tanjiro had survived the immense battle. When a Kasugai Crow announces that Tengen, Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke have defeated an Upper Rank, Kagaya Ubuyashiki becomes ecstatic. With his condition worsening however, he begins to cough blood, causing his wife Amane to worry at his state. Instead, he tells her that an Upper Rank had not been defeated for a hundred years. Kagaya sees this as an omen that fate is taking a dramatic turn, and it will affect everyone greatly. He states that eventually, they will reach ""that man"". Akaza realizes that an Upper Rank has been killed. He reaffirms his promise that they will kill Muzan Kibutsuji without fail in this generation, cursing him as the sole blemish in his family. His coughing begins to worsen, causing his children to rush by his side. Amane urges them to help their father, as they worriedly call out to him. Elsewhere, Akaza sees himself inside the Infinity Castle, and he quickly realizes that he is summoned here because an Upper Rank demon was killed. Tengen is supported by his wives on their way out of Yoshiwara. While he comments on the smarting pain he is feeling, Suma expresses thankfulness that he survived the battle. Makio agrees and Hinatsuru is relieved that the four of them will be returning together; Tengen hopes that they would return like heroes and ""be flashy about it"". Hugging Zenitsu, Inosuke, and Nezuko, Tanjiro cries tears of relief that they survived. Zenitsu exclaims his feeling of relief that the battle is done and Tanjiro tearfully states he is glad that his friends made it out alive in the end.
